energy curve also favorable timeframe expect factor help keep global nitrogen supply demand balance much tighter recent year support extend period higher nitrogen price higher margin advantage network longer term believe increase demand ammonia clean energy attribute become significant factor tighter supply demand balance drive value network continue broad interest clean hydrogen ammonia help meet world clean energy need continue discussion market participant focus remain forefront significant opportunity position network world leader blue green ammonia production collaborate global leader unique capability provide value please progress make look forward additional development come month turn global nitrogen outlook detail follow talk financial position return close comment frost senior vice president sale market development supply global nitrogen supply demand balance remain tighter recent year underpin strong agricultural industrial demand plus higher energy price create highly favorable price environment persist second half year base agricultural energy outlook today believe positive price environment fertilizer remain place least strong global nitrogen demand lead world
