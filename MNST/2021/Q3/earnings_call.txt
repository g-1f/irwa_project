I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.Rodney Sacks -- Chairman and Co-Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Tom. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company achieved record third quarter net sales. During the 2021 third quarter, the Company procured additional quantities of aluminum cans from suppliers in the United States, South America and Asia in response to increased consumer demand. However, the Company continued to experience shortages in its aluminum can requirements in the United States and EMEA during the 2021 third quarter. In addition, the Company continued to experience additional supply chain challenges including freight inefficiencies, trucking availability, shortages of shipping containers, port of entry congestion, insufficient co-packing capacity and delays in receiving certain ingredients in the United States and EMEA.As a result, the Company was not able to fully satisfy increased demand in the United States and EMEA in the 2021 third quarter. During the 2021 third quarter, the Company continued to experience increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing and costs of importing aluminum cans. In addition, the Company experienced increased ingredient and input costs including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees and secondary packaging materials and increased outbound freight costs. All of which resulted in the increased cost of sales and increased operating costs in the 2021 third quarter.

 



The Company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. We are experiencing increased costs in our operations, some of which are likely to be transitory and we have and are in the process of implementing reductions and promotions and other pricing actions in the United States and EMEA to mitigate such increased costs.In the third quarter of 2021, net sales were $1.41 billion compared with $1.25 billion in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 13.2%. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2021 third quarter would have been up 11.9%. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 third quarter was 55.9% compared with 59.1% in the 2020 third quarter.The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2021 was primarily the result of increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing as well as the cost of importing aluminum cans, logistical costs, and geographical sales mix.Operating expenses for the 2021 third quarter was $344.7 million compared with $277.9 million in the 2020 third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 third quarter were 24.4% compared with 22.3% in the 2020 third quarter and 24.5% in the 2019 third quarter pre-COVID. In particular, operating costs were adversely affected by increased logistical inefficiencies, including higher freight out and warehousing costs, a one-time distributor termination fee of $5.3 million and the increased selling and marketing expenses including the resumption of certain sponsorship and event activities as compared to the same quarter last year.A number of sponsorship activities were canceled in the comparable quarter last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating income increased 3.1% to $444.5 million from $458.6 million in the third quarter of 2020, primarily driven by increased input costs, increased transportation, increased selling expenses and a one-time distributor termination fee of $5.3 million. Net income decreased 3% to $337.2 million as compared to $347.7 million in the 2020 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2021 third quarter decreased 3.5% to $0.63 from $0.65 in the third quarter of 2020.According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 23, 2021 all outlets combined namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots increased by 12.8% versus the same period a year ago.

It is important to note that with regard to the decrease in sales of NOS during the third quarter we experienced shortages in the supply of concentrate for NOS, which resulted in reduced production, reduced sales and lack of product availability at retail.The non-supply issues are improving. Sales of Red Bull increased 15.6%, sales of Rockstar decreased by 12.5% and sales of 5-Hour increased 3%. VPX Bang sales increased 5.1%.

Amp's sales increased 55.5% and its market share increased 3.4 points to 18.2%.The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently such activities, could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of September 2021 compared to September 2020. Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 44.2% to 47.6%. Monster energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in Argentina.Monster retail market share in value increased in Brazil from 33% to 37.6% and Natural's Red Bull by only 3.3 points. In Chile, although Monster's net sales in the third quarter was 34% higher, it's retail market share for the month of September decreased from 46.6% to 42.2% due to robust growth in the energy category in Chile, which has grown 65% for the month of September 2021. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.According to Nielsen in the 13 week period ending October 10, 2021, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13.5% to 13.6% in Belgium, from 25.8% to 26.3% in France, from 25.4% to 29% in Great Britain, from 7.5% to 7.7% in the Netherlands, and from 35.8% to 36.7% in Spain.According to Nielsen in the 13 week period till the end of September 2021, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 14.2% to 14.9% in Germany, from 37% to 38.6% in Greece and from 18.3% to 20.2% in South Africa.

Truck shortages also exacerbated our ability to supply and the ability of our bottlers to deliver products to their customers.According to Nielsen in the 13 week period until the end of August 2021, Predator's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 9.8% to 18.6% in Kenya and from 0% to 12.2% in Nigeria.

We are going point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods.Net sales to customers outside the US were $527.4 million, 37.4% of total net sales in the 2021 third quarter compared to $444.5 million or 35.7% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2020.

Primarily due to an unfavorable country product mix and can, freight, and raw material, air freight costs. In local currencies, gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 38.4%.Can supply shortages exacerbated by production disruptions at a major supplier in EMEA, lack of ingredient availability, insufficient caning capacity and a shortage of trucking availability together had an adverse impact on sales in the third quarter in EMEA. In some cases impacting the availability of our products on shelf at retailers. The Company has addressed and continues to address the controllable challenges in its supply train.We are also pleased that in the 2021 third quarter Monster gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.

In the United States, we successfully launched our new True North pure energy sell seltzer line in e-commerce and selected channels and will launch nationally into mainstream channels with our Coca-Cola bottlers in the first quarter of 2022.In October 2021, we commenced the launch of our New Reserve line of Monster energy drinks in two flavors watermelon and white pineapple. In Canada, during July 2021, we successfully launched our Monster Energy Rehab line in three flavors. Rehab Tea plus Lemonade, Peach Tea and Strawberry Lemonade. We successfully launched several new products across Latin America in the third quarter of 2021 including Monster Zero Ultra in Paraguay, Monster Energy Zero Sugar in Peru, Monster Ultra Fiesta Mango in Puerto Rico and Monster Ultra Watermelon in the Caribbean. In the 2021 third quarter, we expanded our Predator Gold Strike footprint in Mexico by launching in a 355 ml slim can.In Brazil, we also launched Monster Pacific Punch, Monster Dragon Tea Peach, Reign Orange Dreamsicle and Reign Mango Magic within a limited territory. We are planning a national launch of all of these products in the first quarter of 2022. In the 2021 third quarter in Australia, we launched two new products in Mother Sugar Free Raspberry and Monster Ultra Fiesta Mango.In the third quarter of 2021, we launched Monster Mule, Monster Nitro and Monster Assault in a number of countries in EMEA. We also launched Ultra Fiesta and Juiced Monster Monarch in a number of countries during the 2021 third quarter. During the quarter, we also launched our strategic brands, innovation and Predator in additional countries. In particular, we launched our Predator malt flavored energy drink in Nigeria. During the third quarter of 2021 we launched Monster Super Fuel, Blue Streak and Red Dawg in July in Japan. Additionally in October 2021, we relaunched Monster Rossi in Japan. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic still impacting the region certain of our planned launches of new products in a number of Asia Pacific markets have been deferred until 2022.However Predator is anticipated to launch later this month in Vietnam. We are planning to launch a number of additional products and/or product lines in our domestic and international markets later this year. We estimate October 2021 sales to be approximately 8.3% higher than in October 2020. On a foreign currency adjusted basis October 2021 sales would have been approximately 7.9% higher than the comparable October 2020 sales. October 2021 had one less selling day than October 2020.Additionally, the Company continue to experience multiple supply chain challenges in October, which adversely impacted sales. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example selling days, days of the week in which holiday fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and you literally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related and unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed.In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Currently, the Company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. The Company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. We are experiencing increased costs in our operations, some of which are likely to be transitory and we have and already in the process of implementing reductions in promotions and other pricing actions in the United States and EMEA to mitigate such increased costs. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is operational and is providing flavors to our EMEA region, which will improve service levels in EMEA.We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio. We are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks in additional international countries. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries.I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
