  OperatorGood morning, and welcome to the Boston Scientific fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. [Operator instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, vice president, investor relations. Please go ahead.Lauren Tengler -- Vice President, Investor Relations

 



 Thank you, Andrew. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, chairman and chief executive officer; and Dan Brennan, executive vice president and chief financial officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 2021 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations on the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will focus his comments on Q4 performance as well as future catalysts and the outlook for our business, including Q1 '22 and full-year '22 guidance. Dan will review the financials for the quarter, provide more details regarding our Q1 and full-year guidance, and then we'll take your questions.During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our chief medical officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation, and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions for organic growth versus 2020 and 2019 include Preventice, Farapulse, Lumenis, which closed in March, August, and September of 2021, respectively; as well as Vertiflex and BTG Interventional Medicines, which closed in May and mid-August of 2019, respectively. Divestitures include BTG Spec Pharma, which closed March 1, 2021, and the global embolic microspheres portfolio and intrauterine health franchise, which were divested in August 2019 and second quarter of 2020, respectively. Throughout the call today, we will refer to 2021 growth rates versus 2019 and 2020, utilizing the comparison to 2019 as the last full year baseline prior to COVID. Going forward, 2022 guidance and corresponding results will be compared to 2021 only.

 



 2022 guidance excludes Baylis Medical acquisition, which is expected to close in Q1 '22. For more information, please refer to Slide 10 of our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified are organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include, among other things, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic upon the company's operations and financial results; statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings, and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike Mahoney -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Lauren, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm very proud of the agility and winning spirit of our employees and continue to be impressed with the resiliency of hospital systems and their ability to provide patients with the care they need during the pandemic. We're very pleased with the strength of our fourth-quarter performance and anticipate that all of our business units either maintained or gained share in the quarter despite the challenges COVID presented. On a full-year basis, the global strength of our product diversification and category leadership strategy resulted in all businesses with the exception of CRM and USEP gaining share.

 



 We look forward to the year ahead and remain bullish in both the near-term and the longer-term opportunities we laid out at our Investor Day. In fourth-quarter '21, total company operational sales grew 17% versus 2020, while organic sales grew 15%, achieving the high end of our guidance range of 12% to 16%. Fourth-quarter '21 organic sales grew 7% versus '19. Full-year 2021 operational sales grew 19% versus 2020, while organic sales grew 19%, again, achieving the high end of our guidance range of 18% to 19%. Full-year '21 organic sales grew 6% versus 2019. Q4 adjusted EPS of $0.45 grew 94% versus 2020 and was flat to 2019, achieving the high end of the guidance range of $0.43 to $0.45. Full-year adjusted EPS of $1.63 grew 69% versus 2020 and 3% versus 2019, again exceeding the high end of the full-year guidance range of $1.60 to $1.62. Fourth-quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.2%, resulting in a second-half 2021 run rate of 25.9%. The full-year '21 adjusted operating margin was 25.3. Overall, we're very pleased about the cash flow with full-year 2021 free cash flow generation of $1.3 billion and adjusted free cash flow of $2.2 billion, which grew 11% versus 2020. So turning to 2022. While we anticipate less of a COVID impact on underlying procedures for the full year 2022 versus 2021, we're providing a wider range to account for uncertainty related to COVID waves and staffing shortages. For first-quarter '22, organic revenue were guiding growth of 5% to 8% and for a full year of 6% to 8%, excluding the Baylis acquisition, which is expected to close in first quarter of 2022. Our Q1 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.38 to $0.40, and we expect our full-year adjusted EPS to be $1.73 to $1.79. Despite the near-term macroeconomic pressures in 2022, we continue to target operating margin expansion with a goal of double-digit adjusted EPS growth at the high end of the range. Dan will provide more details on both sales and EPS performance and outlook, including more insights on 2022. I'll now provide more highlights in Q4 and full-year '21 results along with comments on '22 outlook. Regionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 20% versus fourth quarter 2020 and full-year 21% -- full-year 2021 grew 25%, inclusive of a 300 basis point tailwind from acquisitions and continued strength of new product launches across the portfolio. Europe, Middle East, Africa grew 16% on an operational basis versus both fourth-quarter '20 and full-year '20. We continue to see strong performance in Europe despite the pandemic impact with many of the western countries and excellent growth in the Middle East and Africa region. On a full-year basis, all business units in Europe grew double digits versus the prior year with the majority of businesses gaining share. We continue to anticipate strong growth from our Europe region given the innovative product pipeline, globalization efforts and the integration of the acquisitions. Asia Pac grew 17% operationally versus fourth quarter '20 and 14% for the full year. Within the quarter, the vast majority of Asia Pac countries grew versus prior year with double-digit growth in IC, PI and EP supported by new and ongoing product launches. On a full year, Japan grew 7%, fueled by new products like WATCHMAN FLX, POLARx, and Ranger as well as innovative launches across the coronary therapies portfolio. I'll now provide some additional comments on our business units. Urology and public health sales grew 9% on an organic basis versus fourth quarter '20 and on a full-year basis grew 19% versus 2020 and 11% versus 2019. Within the quarter, SpaceOAR and Rezum both grew double digits, and we're pleased with the 22% improved reimbursement for the ASC and hospital outpatient setting for Rezum. On a full-year basis, we saw strength across the business with double-digit growth in LithoVue, Core Stone, Rezum, SpaceOAR, and Erectile Restoration. As we look forward toward 2022, we remain excited about our strong leadership position further extended by the acquisition of Lumenis in the market-leading MOSES laser technology. Turning to endoscopy, sales grew 10% organically versus fourth quarter '20 with full-year growth of 19% versus '20 and 12% versus 2019. Over the duration of the year, broad-based strength across all regions and franchises resulted in endoscopy business achieving $2 billion in 2021. Within the quarter, we launched the AXIOS stent in China and on a full-year basis grew this product line over 20% globally. We remain excited about the outlook of our innovative offerings within our single-use imaging portfolio, including SpyGlass DS, EXALT Model D, EXALT Model B, and SPY Discover. Looking at 2022, we continue to anticipate above-market growth as the endoscopy global commercial teams continue to execute at a high level by creating long-term partnerships with hospitals, given the unique breadth and differentiation of our portfolio. Turning to CRM. Organic sales grew 4% versus fourth-quarter 2020 and full-year sales grew 8% versus '20 and declined 6% versus '19. In Q4, our high-voltage business grew low single digits, which we expect was in line with the market with improved sequential growth in our S-ICD franchise, enabled by our enhanced electrode launch in June. The pacer business grew mid-single digits, which was likely in line with the market. In December, we enrolled our first patients in the modular ATP trial, our dual-track clinical study for a stand-alone leadless pacemaker as well as to provide antitachycardia pacing to Emblem S-ICD patients. Within the diagnostics franchise, our implantable cardiac monitor, LUX-Dx, continues to perform well and grow share. The Preventice business grew 20% on a full-year pro forma basis, enabled by our differentiated portfolio and strong execution. Electrophysiology sales grew 16% versus fourth quarter '20 on an organic basis, with full-year growth of 23% versus '20 and 7% versus '19. Importantly, the international EP sales grew 38% versus prior on a full-year operational basis, fueled by our innovative portfolio, including POLARx, StablePoint, and Farapulse. The early Farapulse launch is going well in Europe with physicians enthusiastic about the safety and ease of use of this technology. We're very excited about the outlook of the EP business and look forward to further complementing it with the closing of Baylis in first-quarter '22. In Neuromodulation, fourth-quarter organic revenue grew 6% versus prior year and full-year sales grew 19% versus 2020 and were flat to 2019. Despite the COVID wave impacting procedure volumes, we continue to gain share with strong demand for our WaveWriter Alpha systems, and ongoing clinical evidence resulting in a full year SCS growth rate of over 20% versus 2020. Just a few weeks ago, we presented various data sets of NANDs, including the two-year combo RCT data supporting the longevity of our SCS therapy. We continue to roll in the SOLUS trial studying our WaveWriter SCS systems for the treatment of patients with chronic low back and/or leg pain who have not undergone spinal surgery and anticipate initial clinical work on DPN in the coming months. In our brain franchise, while COVID impacted procedure volumes, we continue to enhance our portfolio and capabilities with strong full-year growth in '21 versus 2020. We look forward to expanding our U.S. Vercise Genus offering in '22 in partnership with Brainlab. In interventional cardiology, organic sales grew 40% versus fourth quarter 2020 and 31% versus full-year '20, which includes a tailwind of approximately 1,000 basis points related to sales return reserves for the transition to consignment for WATCHMAN in 2020. Full-year interventional cardiology sales grew 7% versus 2019. In coronary therapies, our complex PCI franchise had strong growth in '21 with strength across every region, further enabled by the recent launch of our AVVIGO II guidance system in the U.S. Within drug-eluting stents, we continue to differentiate our portfolio through the global launches of Synergy 48-millimeter and MEGATRON. We continue to anticipate being first to U.S. market in 2024 with our AGENT drug-coated balloon and expect to complete enrollment in the U.S. IDE trial in the first half of 2022. We're extremely pleased with the performance of WATCHMAN franchise in the fourth quarter as sales surpassed our expectations. Importantly, the 2021 global performance of WATCHMAN was consistent each quarter with strong double-digit growth, resulting in full-year sales of $830 million, growing 68% versus 2019. We continue to be pleased with our ability to deliver the safest and most efficient therapy, increased physician utilization, and global expansion while driving greater awareness to this fast-growing LAAC market. Clinical evidence generation remains an important focus, and we expect the first readout from the ongoing [indiscernible] analysis of the NCDR LAAO registry at CRT later this month. This analysis will include over 16,000 patients and is the largest data set in WATCHMAN FLX patients presented to date. We continue to expect WATCHMAN to be a significant growth driver for Boston Scientific in '22 and beyond. Across the Structural Heart franchises, we had the highest quarterly sales results to date for ACURATE neo2, Sentinel, and the Safari Guidewire. ACURATE neo2 continues to perform well with positive physician feedback on the clinical performance and ease of use of the valve, and we're excited for the year with over 10% share across full European market and are approaching 20% share in open accounts. While we've been pleased with the early clinical progress of the military technology, we have decided to discontinue work in the military program due to the time and financial investment required to commercialize this platform as compared to other near- and long-term portfolio opportunities across the company. We've made this decision now so that we can focus on the execution of existing and future technologies within the structural heart space and elsewhere within our portfolio. In peripheral interventions, organic sales grew 9% versus fourth quarter 2020 with full-year sales growth of 14% versus '20 and 9% versus 2019. Within the drug-eluting portfolio, we've been pleased with the globalization and ongoing clinical evidence supporting Eluvia and Ranger, resulting in exceeding our sales goal of $150 million for 2021. In VENOUS, our market-leading varicose vein offering, Varithena, grew over 40% in 2021, and we see continued runway with this underserved market. In Q4, we closed the Devoro acquisition and look forward to launching our arterial and venous offerings in the second half of 2022, complementing the broader portfolio and further extending our category leadership. In interventional cardiology, TheraSphere grew over 20% on a full-year basis, supported by ongoing clinical evidence, including the EPOCH trial, which is the first positive Phase 3 SIRT trial studying TheraSphere as a second-line therapy in patients with liver-dominant MCRC that have failed first-line chemotherapy. Our focus on improving patient health comes with a responsibility to have a positive impact in the world we share. Our environmental, social, and governance practices guide us as we make long-term measurable progress, and I'm proud to announce that Boston Scientific received the 2022 Catalyst Award, the premier recognition for organizations' initiatives that advance women in the workplace. Boston Scientific also ranked in the top 50 of America's Most JUST Companies for our contributions to creating jobs, providing benefits and work-life balance, cultivating a diverse and inclusive workplace and producing sustainable products, and building stronger communities. I'm grateful for the passion and commitment of our global team as we continue to deliver our values and do our part to create a better future, both as a global business and as a global corporate citizen. While we have faced challenges over the last few years of COVID, we are stronger for it. We're building new capabilities that will enable us to better serve our patients and customers, both today and the future. We are well-positioned in 2022 with category-leading innovative product positions, continue to focus on investment in clinical evidence while continuing to enter high-growth adjacent markets. We acquired several companies in the past year, with innovative products that are accretive markets, and we continue to evolve our leadership and commercial structures to best enable these exciting new technologies. We remain committed to our long-term financial goals of 6% to 8% organic revenue growth, operating margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EPS growth with strong cash flow generation. I'm very grateful to our employees for their winning spirit, I will now turn things over to Dan to review our financial performance and forward-looking expectations.Dan Brennan -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Mike. Fourth-quarter consolidated revenue of $3.127 billion represents 15.4% reported revenue growth versus fourth quarter 2020 and reflects a $38 million headwind from foreign exchange. On an operational basis, revenue growth was 16.9% in the quarter. Sales from the acquisitions of Preventice, Farapulse, and Lumenis contributed 330 basis points, partially offset by the divestiture of the BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals business, resulting in 15.1% organic revenue growth toward the high end of our guidance range of 12% to 16% growth versus 2020. This 15.1% growth includes a 440-basis-point tailwind from the WATCHMAN sales return reserve recognized in Q4 2020, which was contemplated in our guidance. Compared to fourth-quarter 2019, organic revenue growth was 6.7%, nicely above the midpoint of our guidance range of 4% to 8%. This 6.7% growth excludes $67 million in 2019 sales of the divested intrauterine health and BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals businesses as well as $89 million in 2021 sales of acquired businesses, including Preventice, Farapulse, and Lumenis. Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $0.45 represents 94% growth versus 2020 and flat versus 2019 and achieved the high end of our guidance range of $0.43 to $0.45, driven by revenue performance at the higher end of our guidance range and a slightly favorable adjusted tax rate. Full-year 2021 consolidated revenue of $11.888 billion represents 19.9% reported revenue growth versus the full year 2020 and reflects a $126 million tailwind from foreign exchange. On an operational basis, revenue growth was 18.7% in the quarter versus 2020. Sales from the acquisitions of Preventice, Farapulse, and Lumenis contributed 210 basis points, more than offset by sales of the divested intrauterine health and BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals businesses, resulting in 18.9% organic revenue growth within our guidance range of 18% to 19%. Compared to full-year 2019, organic growth was 5.7%, again, above the midpoint of our guidance range of 5% to 6%. This 5.7% growth excludes $131 million in 2019 sales of divested businesses as well as $531 million in 2021 sales of acquired businesses, including Vertiflex, BTG Interventional Medicines, Preventice, Farapulse, and Lumenis, and $13 million of specialty pharmaceutical sales prior to divestiture. Full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $1.63 represent 69% growth versus 2020, 3% growth versus 2019, and exceeded the high end of our guidance range of $1.60 to $1.62. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.9%, in line with our expectations of a slight sequential improvement from the 70.6% recorded in Q3. We continue to face macro-environment headwinds on gross margin, which included the cost of running plants with COVID-specific measures, increased freight costs and price pressures and higher direct labor wages. As the omicron variant surged, we saw increased headwinds particularly in December with higher levels of COVID-related absenteeism in our plants as well as price pressure on direct material costs, driving unfavorable manufacturing variances. As a reminder, manufacturing variances are capitalized on the balance sheet and realized over an approximate six-month period. As a result, we expect full-year 2022 gross margin to improve slightly versus the second half of 2021. Gross margins in the first half of 2022 are expected to be below the second half of 2021, driven by the lagging impact of unfavorable manufacturing branches capitalized on the balance sheet and typical standard cost revaluation. In line with our historical trends, we anticipate that the second half of 2022 gross margins will be improved versus the first half, driven by lower COVID-related headwinds and recognition of full 2022 standard cost improvements. Our longer-term goal remains to return to pre-COVID gross margin levels of 72% plus as global supply chain disruptions and inflation lessen over time. Fourth-quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.2%, resulting in a second-half average of 25.9%. Full-year adjusted operating margin was 25.3%. In light of increased gross margin pressures, we felt it was prudent to provide a range for 2022 adjusted operating margin and expect the full year to be within a range of 26% to 26.4%, representing a 70- to 110-basis-point improvement over the full year of 2021, with the high end representing our long-range plan goal of 50 basis points annual improvement versus second-half average 2021. On a GAAP basis, fourth-quarter operating margins were 5.8% and includes a $197 million intangible asset impairment related to the discontinuation of the Millipede program, as Mike outlined, and a $128 million in litigation-related expenses, which I'll provide further details on in a moment. Moving below the line, adjusted interest and other expense totaled $115 million in Q4 and $423 million for the full year 2021, in line with expectations. Our fourth-quarter tax rate was 5.3% on an adjusted basis. Our full-year adjusted tax rate of 7.6% includes discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Excluding these items, our operational tax rate was 8.8% favorable to our expectations, driven by our geographic mix of earnings. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.436 billion shares in Q4 and 1.434 billion shares for full-year 2021. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $425 million, and free cash flow was $217 million with $478 million from operating activities, less $261 million of net capital expenditures. For full-year 2021, we delivered adjusted free cash flow of $2.2 billion and free cash flow of $1.3 billion with $1.9 billion from operating activities, less $540 million of net capital expenditures. We exceeded our expectations for full-year adjusted free cash flow with growth of 11% versus 2020 driven by lower working capital as we balance increasing our inventory position with sales recovery and finished the year with a favorable DSO. For 2022, adjusted free cash flow, we aim to be at or above 2021 while we continue to invest in inventory with less COVID-related impact on our manufacturing, labor, and direct material availability. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash on hand of $1.9 billion. We continue to expect to close the acquisition of Baylis Medical in Q1 funded with cash on hand. Our top priority for capital remains high-quality tuck-in M&A, and we'll continue to assess opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals. With respect to our legal reserves, we booked $128 million in Q4, which includes $60 million related to ongoing litigation in the neuromodulation space and $68 million related to mesh product liability claims in Australia. There's been no material change to the outlook for the U.S. mesh claims over the last three years. Materially, all U.S. claims remain settled, and we continue to seek prompt resolution of active cases and claims. Our total legal reserve was $548 million as of December 31, 2021. I'll now walk through guidance for Q1 and the full year 2022. As a reminder, guidance does not include the acquisition of Baylis Medical since it has not yet closed. We expect full-year 2022 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates and includes 110 basis point contribution from the acquisitions of Preventice, Farapulse, and Lumenis, and $13 million of pre-divestiture specialty pharmaceutical sale in 2021. Excluding the impact of closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect full-year 2022 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 6% to 8% versus 2021. We expect first quarter 2022 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 10% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 200-basis-point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates and includes 210 basis point contribution from the acquisitions of Preventice, Farapulse, and Lumenis, and $13 million of predivestiture specialty pharmaceutical sales in 2021. Excluding the impact of closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect first-quarter 2022 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 5% to 8% versus 2021. We forecast our full-year 2022 operational tax rate to be approximately 13% with an adjusted tax rate of 12%, including the benefit from the accounting standard for stock compensation. Of note, our forecasted tax rate includes a headwind from delayed provisions in the 2017 TCJA that take effect in 2022 related to the treatment of R&D expenditures. We believe there is bipartisan support to reverse these provisions and if such legislation were to be enacted, we would expect our tax rate to revert to its historic range of approximately 11% operational and 10% adjusted. We expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in a range of $1.73 to $1.79 and for the first quarter to be in a range of $0.38 to $0.40. A few other items to keep in mind as you look to model 2022. We expect below-the-line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our VC portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $400 million for the year. Preferred stock dividends will be approximately $55 million for the year, and we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.443 billion shares for Q1 2022 and 1.447 billion shares for the full year 2022. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2021 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more detailed Q4 results. With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A.Lauren Tengler -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, Dan. Andrew, let's open it up for questions for the next 30 minutes or so. [Operator instructions] Andrew, please go ahead.
