three month million case infection worldwide omicron death toll turn almost higher delta wave clear virus capable make large evolutionary leap structure function hopeful enter period relative stability northern hemisphere believe firmly vaccine booster dose require fall provide ongoing protection virus measure take unite recently offer additional booster dose higher risk believe measure become widespread government look protect population disease later year support healthcare system always huge note appreciation frontline worker healthcare worker continue immunize protect pandemic tireless work save million life worldwide review data today underpin believe additional booster require certainly fall first share data study almost individual unite state veteran administration database look effectiveness primary series vaccination know vaccine extremely safe effective data show exceptional effectiveness power prospectively design comparative effectiveness study significantly reduce risk infection hospitalization compare data continue underpin strong global confidence government healthcare system individual vaccine indeed example recent announcement preferential vaccine anyone year live immunocompromised similar pattern result real world effectiveness study unite graph show come unite health security agency look effect either pfizer vaccine vaccine effectiveness hospitalization first show result people primary vaccination receive pfizer vaccine boost either pfizer vaccine vaccine retain protection delta variant concern field square effect field circle omicron true though next part graph individual receive primary vaccine vaccine large real world assessment provide protection hospitalization delta lesser extent omicron infection note protection time hospitalization omicron infection profound immune invasion know case omicron also driver belief booster vaccination require later also booster require protect delta omicron variant concern announce earlier delta know associate strong omicron transmissibility also associate substantial morbidity strain healthcare system sheer bulk case hence protection delta omicron necessary next booster vaccination slide data directly explain clinical phenomenon show data come previously conduct clinical study serum individual immunize boost able substantially neutralize ancestral virus show black lesser extent omicron show particularly true month follow booster administration data couple real world effectiveness data show lead believe additional booster dose need later provide protection delta omicron variant concern point make clearly slide estimate duration protection either ancestral strain omicron lower start titer protection omicron wane forward level would begin allow breakthrough infection occur omicron around nine month boost leader vaccine disease continue monitor carefully along emerge variant continue whatever provide people safe highly effective vaccine booster year come announce able identification omicron test vaccine human month remarkable testament platform utility slide familiar many first present slide vaccine graph illustration different phase pandemic endemic continuum effect measure morbidity disease burden time shape graph adopt know previous pandemic time expect current pandemic take consideration increase level immunity immune system collectively become virus either infection vaccination graph show hindsight easy recognize first wave pandemic world population naive virus cause highest level morbidity mortality subsequent wave delta late early omicron morbidity observe wave tend severe certainly relative first wave immune system become experience fight virus beyond still remain uncertainty however give know pandemic like influenza pandemic importantly observe pandemic believe transition endemic phase mark period stability case count hospitalization death least northern hemisphere continue carefully monitor situation southern hemisphere winter approach background continue delta omicron infection pressure work quickly possible generate specific booster vaccine data endemic phase virus continue rate static predictable continue expect morbidity virus endemic believe like respiratory virus seasonal pattern disease emerge good news immune system much familiar virus either vaccination infection expect majority population susceptible severe disease endemic phase pandemic phase instead respiratory virus believe protection critical population likely susceptible severe disease high burden disease provide broadest protection possible focus endemic phase believe mention multivalent vaccine variant help achieve earlier respiratory virus significant disease annually endemic coronaviruses exception slide show incidence community acquire infection lead hospitalization city season prior pandemic chart endemic human coronaviruses fact highest level hospitalization individual year year follow influenza across country estimate impact endemic human coronaviruses lead million outpatient visit hospitalization death year population annually believe follow similar pattern seasonal disease respiratory virus impact vulnerable population protect population critical month year come protect combination respiratory virus single yearly central strategy shortly provide update robust ongoing strategy achieve summary available real world data continue show remarkable effectiveness real world data show microgram booster dose provide protection hospitalization cause omicron note antibody titer month post boost believe fall booster need globally leader vaccine believe important develop booster vaccine give opportunity protect omicron future variant continue fight help pandemic hand provide update topic pipeline president thank good morning good afternoon everyone slide like briefly summarize booster development strategy endemic phase cover strategic rationale seasonal booster three part first think neutralize titer wane similar endemic human coronaviruses describe decline neutralize titer increase risk breakthrough hospitalization higher risk specifically include older adult immune compromise think emergence variant concern also risk accelerate broaden risk breakthrough population desire feature northern hemisphere fall winter booster describe first like improve durability protection neutralize antibody omicron omicron mutation least month provide full protection northern hemisphere fall winter infection season like retain high durable protection prototype vaccine delta ancestral strain third like broaden cross protective immunity extent possible increase potential protection emergent variant concern could emerge perhaps southern hemisphere midyear slide quickly summarize strategy develop update booster fall currently evaluate three different booster strategy adult plus first mention bivalent booster vaccine make prototype omicron specific bivalent call also evaluate previously announce omicron specific booster course continue evaluate prototype booster large body real world evidence describe evaluate three different approach across study unite state unite phase study unite state approximately participant participant study unite look bivalent omicron specific booster look third fourth dose booster study also look heterologous boost include background vaccine vaccine like take moment slide provide scientific insight believe bivalent vaccine booster fall offer potential advantage slide include data prior bivalent booster data emerge data suggest opportunity improve durability variant concern preserve activity ancestral variant data base prior short recall base vaccine beta variant concern emerge approximately year compare time different booster strategy prototype booster leave hand column bivalent booster right hand column different virus variant vaccine emergence potential improvement durability first orient slide give microgram booster previously receive vaccine leave panel neutralize titer pseudovirus neutralize titer ancestral strain virus virus validate clinical assay underneath pseudovirus neutralization titer beta variant concern blue middle column contrast bivalent booster case include beta variant concern dose level microgram right panel ancestral variant concern ancestral virus lower right beta variant concern note compare performance ancestral virus bivalent beta contain booster good boost neutralize titer booster month post booster neutralize titer approximately bivalent importantly test serum month booster note neutralize titer remain high approximately booster situation variant concern case beta slightly different booster increase neutralize titer month booster quite reasonable level approximately case however follow month difference neutralize titer emerge surprisingly bivalent booster include beta variant concern start durable neutralize titer note oppose summary month bivalent booster neutralize titer beta variant concern appear durable prototype booster durability rate decline beta neutralize titer closely match ancestral virus follow bivalent booster include beta variant concern therefore appear improve durability neutralize titer variant concern next slide slide data plot function time help visualize little clearly leave hand side contrast booster black line bivalent beta contain booster line leave hand side look ancestral neutralize titer follow booster approximately month dose neutralize titer booster bivalent prototype vaccine increase significantly data month project forward line suggest maintain quite high neutralize titer perhaps long year situation right hand side highlight think potential improve durability bivalent vaccine black line line bivalent beta contain booster dose level booster increase neutralize titer approximately within month boost start emerge month later different degree durability neutralize titer bivalent vaccine contain beta antigen slightly better line project forward suggest bivalent vaccine neutralize titer beta variant concern remain quite high perhaps long year whereas prototype vaccine neutralize titer appear decay quickly back toward baseline level booster level approximately eight nine month slide quickly summarize therefore booster development fall believe seasonal booster necessary prevent breakthrough disease include hospitalization vulnerable population believe continue evolution virus continue pressure exist immunity whether naturally derive vaccine provide think fall booster reflect diversity mutation order seek achieve greater month neutralize titer durability increase potential protection throughout entire fall season case think develop omicron contain bivalent booster base data prior bivalent candidate suggest incorporate variant concern mutation variant concern potential improve durability variant concern move slide quickly
