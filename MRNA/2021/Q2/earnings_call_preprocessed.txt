head infectious disease good morning good afternoon everyone name lead therapeutic area infectious disease pleasure today give update ongoing accumulation data phase clinical study also talk publication real world evidence occur outside vaccine slide line update efficacy trial efficacy data follow four month subject receive second vaccination either placebo recall time submission primary efficacy analysis demonstrate efficacy four month second dose maintenance efficacy lower limit confidence interval continue maintain efficacy severe disease update vaccine efficacy currently efficacy death cause unfortunately three death placebo group till none group continue consistency subgroup analysis include analysis gender race medical condition safety profile continue consistent phase data longer period safety follow also continue consistent across population subgroup next slide please slide efficacy data break time interval table overall efficacy discuss primary endpoint start measure vaccine efficacy dose look post dose month dose observe vaccine efficacy look month dose four month dose finally greater four month dose observe efficacy conclusion take data efficacy remain consistently high durable throughout period follow intend continue follow data trial open label phase report different move forward give subject placebo group recently vaccinate think important continue follow subject remain initial vaccination slide data consistent also study outside clinical trial begin real world effectiveness data demonstrate maintain effectiveness consistent study report unite importantly trial confirm vaccine effectiveness strain also merge variance concern include alpha beta gamma delta variant even partial vaccination vaccination single dose move slide hand presentation review booster strategy clinical data review pipeline president thank move slide want start update perspective impact strategy booster first emerge perspective believe today increase force infection result delta variant fatigue intervention seasonal effect move indoors eventually lead increase breakthrough infection vaccinate individual fact report already durable phase efficacy month describe expect neutralize continue wane eventually impact vaccine efficacy give intersection rise force infection immunity believe dose three booster likely necessary keep safe possible winter season northern hemisphere inform booster strategy primary approach since early year advance portfolio booster candidate potential emerge variant concern large number ongoing clinical study provide update today booster evaluate often different dose level microgram microgram fall broadly three category first prototype vaccine describe primary efficacy data phase study second look various specific booster candidate delta variant specific third look multivalent platform combine different variant single vaccine first program program include delta antigen goal multivalent platform continue stay ahead virus combine different antigen emerge period concern like provide brief update today three exist program variant specific booster candidate beta strain first multivalent vaccine move slide comparison three candidate phase study quickly start leave hand side look validate clinical assay assay conduct collaborator phase study earlier clinical work look wild type virus neutralization three different booster approach array leave right prototype beta specific variant concern multivalent combination beta reminder three dose microgram show leave hand side pseudovirus neutralization titer validate assay immediately prior boost case participant study previously receive vaccine describe approximately eight month participate clinical study offer chance booster baseline eight month primary series neutralize titer somewhat lower three case booster dose vaccine three booster able substantially increase neutralization wild type virus fold approximately fold beta variant concern fold multivalent platform virus leave variance concern time initiate study particularly concern variant name beta variant gamma variant assay evaluate performance booster vaccine week booster compare ancestral virus elsewhere three case compare boost happen compare level titer neutralize titer group people month month post second dose strong boost variant concern three booster strategy fact encourage prototype vaccine able increase titer strain gamma strain look leave level boost might slightly higher multivalent platform directionally higher titer particularly stream overall boost remain strong across three variant three approach result data make determination variant concern believe prototype vaccine sufficient booster obvious advantage work beta include variant booster time also worth note epidemiology move away beta variant concern toward delta variant concern speak extensively delta variant concern move slide present data submit manuscript actually press speak look performance month primary series variance concern third dose booster micron pseudovirus neutralization titer research assay show orient quickly slide look wild type beta gamma delta variant concern data first three column deal month post dose immediately follow primary vaccination series really strong efficacy data describe high titer wild type strain assay group substantially lower titer beta gamma variant concern previously report follow subject forward month eight second dose wild type virus although remain detectable level titer also variance concern particularly beta gamma delta fact appreciate middle four beta gamma delta neutralize titer fall detectable level detection assay decent number participant three case great news microgram dose able boost four viral strength post dose three show titer right four fold boost wild type strain level significantly level second dose month post dose fold boost beta fold boost gamma fold boost delta reach level significantly higher previously encourage think confirm selection prototype booster likely protective variance concern particularly delta presently advance program micron booster phase something parallel slide happy provide update phase result larger study prototype booster earlier year phase study amend offer third dose microgram interest participant month second dose vaccine total participant elect receive dose line result report manuscript preparation submit shortly result generally consistent already share inaudible data mean neutralize antibody titer wind significantly prior boost month surprise third dose microgram boost neutralize titer level phase benchmark clinically validate assay colleague third dose similar level neutralize titer achieve across group importantly subgroup analysis older adult able boost significantly achieve level comparable younger adult really encourage safety profile follow dose three microgram similar observe previously dose total think really encourage data potential microgram booster move slide leave booster strategy delay third dose approximately month vaccination believe booster dose likely necessary fall particularly face delta variant clinical data right think support microgram booster obvious advantage beta contain variant candidate drive data present today evolve epidemiology wait microgram data come week confirm dose selection microgram booster file move booster like provide little bite update part pipeline move slide excite update today first seasonal influenza vaccine candidate enter clinic move quickly toward ongoing phase study remind quadrivalent seasonal vaccine target recommend strength vision eventually combine seasonal vaccine respiratory vaccine booster adult elderly population combine booster potentially respiratory virus
