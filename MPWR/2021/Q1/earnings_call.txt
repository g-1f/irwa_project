GAAP gross margin was 55.4% 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 and 20 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2020. Our GAAP operating income was $46.1 million, compared with $40.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020.For the first quarter of 2021, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.8% 10 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2020 and 30 basis points better than the first quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP operating income was $75.8 million, compared to $66.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020.Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $95.0 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared with $88.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2021 operating expenses were $66.2 million, up from the $63.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters' discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan.For the first quarter of 2021 total stock compensation expense including approximately $816,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $28.6 million, compared with $23.0 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. Switching to the bottom line, first quarter 2021 GAAP net income was $45.4 million or $0.95 per fully diluted share compared with $42.9 million or $0.90 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020.First quarter of 2021 non-GAAP net income was $69.5 million or $1.46 per fully diluted share compared with $62.5 million or $1.31 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2020. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1, 2021 were $47.7 million.Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $641.6 million at the end of the first quarter of 2021 compared to $598.0 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. For the quarter MPS generated operating cash flow of about $77.1 million, compared with operating cash flow of $79.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. First quarter 2021 capital spending totaled $19 million.Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2021 at $84.1 million or 30 days of sales outstanding up four days from 26 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2021 were $175 million, up from the $157.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Days of inventory increased to 141 days at the end of Q1 2021, compared with 137 days at the end of fourth quarter of 2020.Historically, we've calculated days of inventory on hand is a function of the current quarters revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarters revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, you can see days of inventory increased slightly to 128 days at the end of the first quarter of 2021 from 126 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020.I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2021. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $274 million to $286 million. We also expect to follow GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.1% to 55.7%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.5% to 56.1%, GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $95.9 million and $99.9 million.Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $65.5 million to $67.5 million, this estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Totals stock-based compensation expense of $31.4 million to $33.4 million, including approximately $1 million that would be charged costs of goods sold, litigation expenses ranging between $2.3 million and $2.7 million.Interest and other income is expected to range from $1.3 million to $1.7 million before foreign exchange gains or losses, fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.3 million to 48.3 million shares. In conclusion, we have paved the way to multi-billion dollar revenue.I will now open the webinar for questions.
