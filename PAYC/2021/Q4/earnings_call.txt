 Thanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. We ended 2021 with a very strong quarter, and I'd like to thank all of our employees for the outstanding effort they put in to making 2021 a great success. I will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our fourth quarter 2021 results. Then I will review some of our notable achievements throughout the year. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions. 2021 was a very strong year for Paycom. We extended our platform to the employee even further through innovations like BETI, which enables employees to do their own payroll, and we are seeing very strong adoption and record employee usage as measured by the DDX. Strong demand continues to bolster our sales momentum, and record new client sales in 2021 have positioned us to deliver another year of rapid growth in 2022. For years, I have been predicting the end of the old model, whereby HR and payroll personnel's routine of inputting data for employees, is replaced by a self-service model that provides employees direct access to the database. The old model is dying and that is good for both the business and the employee. Paycom is leading this transformation. We will continue to automate the processes that generate maximum ROI for our clients. Our 2021 fourth-quarter revenue of $285 million came in very strong, up 29% year over year. Our full year 2021 revenue of $1,056,000,000 grew 25% compared to 2020. Employee usage, which is at a record high, is a key driver of revenue retention, and I'm pleased to announce that Paycom's annual revenue retention rate increased once again to 94% this year, which is a validation of the strong ROI our clients are achieving. Our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA was $419 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of nearly 40%.

 



 The sum of our 2021 revenue growth rate and adjusted EBITDA margin resulted in us hitting the Rule of 65, reflecting the solid demand for our solutions and the profitability of our business model, and was well ahead of our stated goal to reach the Rule of 60. As you can see with our full year 2022 guidance, we are starting strong with the Rule of 65. Our marketing plan throughout 2021 continue to perform well, delivering strong demo leads throughout the year as we spent aggressively on advertising. More importantly, our sales teams are successfully closing these leads, which is the key driver to our revenue growth. In her first year as our Chief Sales Officer, Holly Faurot has executed fabulously on her sales plan, and I'm very pleased with the coordination we are seeing across the sales and marketing organizations. We are capitalizing on the shortcomings of disparate HCM systems that are failing both the employees who struggle to use them and the businesses that struggle just to make them work. Our proven single-database platform just works better, and we continue to differentiate ourselves with easy-to-use solutions that enhance the employee experience and generate maximum ROI for our clients. In response to increasing demand in 2021, we expanded the upper end of our target client size range from 5,000 to 10,000 employees as we are seeing success selling to larger clients. We are also concurrently expanding geographically to meet the increased demand. In addition to the Manhattan office we announced a few months ago, we recently opened four outside sales offices in the following locations: Las Vegas, Jacksonville, New England, and South Jersey. We have now opened five offices in the last five months. That said, I'd remind everyone that we still only have approximately 5% of the TAM today, so there's plenty of runway ahead to expand and continue to capture market share. Paycom received national recognition from several organizations in 2021. Our latest innovation, BETI, was awarded a Top HR Product of the Year honor. As a workplace, we earned a top 20 ranking in best places to work in the U.S. by Top Workplaces, and we were named a top workplace in Oklahoma for the ninth consecutive year. We were also named the best company for women to work. These awards are a testament to our execution and thriving corporate culture. As of December 31, 2021, our headcount stood at 5,385 employees, up 28% year over year as we continue to have great success attracting and retaining high-quality talent to further bolster our future growth. Additionally, I want to congratulate the 2021 Paycom Jim Thorpe Award winner, Coby Bryant from the University of Cincinnati. This award recognizes the most outstanding defensive back in college football and memorializes Jim Thorpe, who is one of the greatest all-around athletes in history. Jim Thorpe also happened to be in Oklahoma. To sum up, we are executing well on all fronts with innovative solutions, high employee usage, and increasing revenue retention. Robust market demand and our proven go-to-market strategy are fueling strong new client revenue momentum. I'd like to thank our employees for help making 2021 such a strong year, and we are set up to do even better in 2022 and we're off to a great start. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig?Craig Boelte -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, and Corporate Secretary Thanks, Chad. Before I review our fourth quarter and full-year results for 2021 and our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2022, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We ended the year with very strong results, delivering a milestone full year 2021 revenue total of $1,056,000,000, up 25.4% compared to 2020. Fourth-quarter results were excellent with total revenues of $285 million representing growth of 29% over the comparable prior-year period. Our revenue growth is driven by strong demand, new business wins, and adoption of recent new product offerings. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $280 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 29% from the comparable prior-year period. We ended 2021 with nearly 34,000 clients, representing a growth rate of 9% compared to 2020. On a parent company grouping basis, we ended the year with roughly 17,700 clients, representing a growth rate of 10% compared to 2020. Total adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $239.7 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 84.1%. For the full year 2021, our adjusted gross margin was 85.1%. For 2022, our target adjusted gross margin range is expected to remain strong at approximately 85% to 86%. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $72.3 million or 25.4% of revenues. Our marketing strategy in 2021 has been very effective at driving high-quality demo leads, and our outside and inside sales teams have been doing a great job closing these leads. We plan to continue to invest in marketing in Q1 and throughout 2022. In addition, as Chad said, we have added four more outside sales offices bringing the total outside sales office opening to five new openings in the last five months. We also continue to add inside sales personnel as we grow our sales organization to meet the demand. Adjusted R&D expense was $32.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 or 11.3% of total revenue. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $33.2 million in the prior-year period. We aggressively recruited talent in R&D throughout the pandemic, and we plan to continue to invest in our future growth through innovation and new product development. Adjusted EBITDA was $109.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 or 38.4% of total revenues, compared to $84.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 or 38.1% of total revenues. For the full year 2021, adjusted EBITDA was $419.3 million or 39.7% of total revenues, compared to $330.8 million or 39.3% of total revenues in 2020. Our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $48.7 million or $0.84 per diluted share versus $24.4 million or $0.42 per diluted share in the prior-year period based on approximately 58 million shares. For the full year 2021, our GAAP net income was $196 million or $3.37 per diluted share. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 30.4%. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $64.4 million or $1.11 per diluted share versus $49.1 million or $0.84 per diluted share in the prior-year period. For the full year 2021, our non-GAAP net income was $260.4 million or $4.48 per diluted share versus $203.5 million or $3.49 per diluted share in the prior-year period. For 2022, we anticipate our full-year effective income tax rate to be approximately 28% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with Q1 GAAP effective tax rate expected to be approximately 30%. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $278 million and total debt of $29 million. Cash from operations was $319 million in 2021, representing an increase of 40.6%, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. During 2021, we repurchased approximately 164,000 shares for a total of roughly $65.6 million. Through December 31, 2021, Paycom has repurchased nearly 4.3 million shares since 2016 for a total of nearly $488 million, and we currently have $266 million remaining in our buyback program. Now, let me turn to guidance for fiscal 2022. We expect revenue in the range of $1,314,000,000 to $1,316,000,000 or nearly 25% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $524 million to $526 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 40% at the midpoint of the range. We are starting this year's guidance at the Rule of 65. For the first quarter of 2022, we expect total revenues in the range of $342 million to $344 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior-year period of 26% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter in the range of $161 million to $163 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 47% at the midpoint of the range. 2021 was a very strong year for Paycom as a direct result of the investments we made. We will continue to invest in talent, marketing, innovation, customer service, and geographic expansion to meet the strong demand we are experiencing and to support our high expectations for long-term future growth. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator?
