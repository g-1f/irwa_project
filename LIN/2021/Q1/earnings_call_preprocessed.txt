inflation already demonstrate last quarter anticipate upside economy continue recover finally continue grow capitalize future opportunity linde demonstrate highest compound growth rate industry across financial metric expect maintain distinction currently secular growth driver around market comprise sale healthcare electronics familiar happen electronic space today customer look expand production chip meet demand improve strengthen local supply chain logistics integral part development industrial critical component successfully operate modern today fully expect electronics comprise largest portion backlog next couple year continue high level interest customer build furthermore healthcare market continue grow combination demographic trend toward telehealth know healthcare business particularly home care business serve critical second line defense recent pandemic course expect future trend create growth opportunity allow leverage lead dense network support momentum toward distribute healthcare market combination strategic element enable grow annual earn share average something demonstrate throughout history feel confident continue long term notice outlook exclude impact transition clean energy currently view benefit transition incremental outlook clean energy course topic know fact quite realize many global hydrogen expert really month however produce store supply hydrogen enable cleaner fuel something decade fact hydrogen fastest grow molecule past year give like last slide provide view overall clean energy market explain linde exceptionally position succeed share strategy forward start want state provide specific guidance either expect sale clean energy time rapidly evolve landscape many country take different path pace transition uncertain make multiyear detail projection however confirm linde experience technology asset network significant player transition elaborate like provide view clean energy market next slide slide safe nobody really know decarbonization market ultimately play helpful start overview potential opportunity think clean energy transition main piece first provide solution manage carbon second relate clean hydrogen development already number significant application reduce capture sequester clean monetize stream good example current carbon dioxide business billion serve several market look ahead opportunity technology solution enable customer reduce carbon footprint capture removal emission furthermore believe blue green hydrogen play important role transition cleaner energy theory total available opportunity represent current trillion hydrocarbon market however serve blend solution take year evolve example estimate assume clean hydrogen reach billion roughly today hydrocarbon market time tell give uncertainty provide specific estimate time line today want reiterate significant opportunity linde something upside base business backdrop helpful understand linde bring table regard technology asset network experience find next slide slide seven whether production distribution application service year experience owner operator billion dollar hydrogen infrastructure agnostic molecule make whether reform chemistry electrolysis technology operate expertise furthermore largest dense hydrogen distribution network world crucial ensure safe reliable effective energy transition technology many proprietary application extend service capability position exceptionally opportunity finally also ability leverage engineer business integrate various technology solution offer sale selectively sale equipment provide unique competitive advantage overall long successful history support transition clean energy believe incredibly position across entire value chain initiative accelerate like wrap clean energy discussion next slide slide eight view strategy give support example strategy leave something mention represent prove approach profitably grow industrial business include hydrogen start leverage lead integrate asset network addition execute locally market drive strategy believe many initiative vary country also expect continue advance grow technology leadership space across value chain leverage expertise engineer develop partnership provide access insight hopefully accelerate opportunity right hand side slide three project recently announce want remind part base capex therefore include billion backlog project million green blue hydrogen infrastructure south unite state pick example south partner largest industrial conglomerate build liquid hydrogen infrastructure fuel municipality continue evaluate significant grow number opportunity large small irrespective size opportunity always maintain discipline approach pursue project meet investment criterion summarize midterm strategy currently clean energy market something provide update future continue evolve hand want make final point initiative simply embed culture part operate rhythm part compensation philosophy integral part value form foundation linde mission statement make world productive please currently track ahead many initiative early include carbon emission intensity reduction increase gender diversity enough know need therefore process thoughtfully develop ambitious goal expect share future call certain continue improve performance area hand take financial result guidance white

volume continue recover grow last year fourth quarter sequentially negative seasonal effect temporary outage coast storm offset broad base increase volume industrial production level consistently rise geography support volume recovery package merchant supply mode note temporary negative effect sale first quarter profit impact immaterial contractual structure refer market trend appendix every market grow sequentially prior year except food mostly restaurant closure seasonality distribution business price improvement line globally weight inflation since majority contract mechanism place adjust local inflation operate profit increase prior year combination higher price incremental volume lower base furthermore operate margin expand basis point mark seventh consecutive quarter expand operate margin basis point grow last year sequentially wider normal growth rate differential operate profit mostly drive joint venture deconsolidation another strong quarter capital management operate cash flow return capital reach level trend continue grow earn double digit percent maintain discipline focus capital allocation process capex prior year temporary decline project backlog spend offset increase growth project categorize base capex approximately base capex growth include clean energy project mention majority small site announce yesterday overall result clearly validate positive leverage economic recovery offer significant downside protection evidence slide provide update capital management process start cash generation leave side linde employee great focus cash conversion thus make capital available company deploy available operate cash flow define operate cash flow base capex exceed billion last quarter continue generate healthy level cash spend equally important show
