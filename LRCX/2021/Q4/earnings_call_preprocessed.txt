presentation call schedule last pacific time replay call make available later afternoon website hand call president chief executive officer thank happy year join today calendar another year company community respond significant challenge many front operation result impact effect labor shortage freight logistics escalation supply chain constraint proud thankful employee respond every turn commitment agility support customer business digital transformation global economy everyday activity accelerate throughout year demand wafer fabrication equipment continue strengthen deliver record revenue record earn share calendar year embed result record revenue every area business include foundry logic within every subsegment customer support business even year relatively higher foundry logic spend versus memory gain market share etch deposition close enter year demand product never higher discuss prior quarter global supply chain remain severely stress unprecedented output level quarter unexpected shipment delay primarily component critical supplier surface last week quarter leave insufficient time full recovery despite diligent effort supplier global operation result shipment delay cause revenue come midpoint guidance range revenue tool impact recognize march quarter look first week supply challenge broaden omicron surge disruption freight logistics operation skilled labor shortage also continue encounter significant scarcity certain component part include semiconductor result march quarter revenue level limit output constraint global supply chain reflect guidance aggressively work issue supplier believe progressive improvement move next quarter overall calendar year expect deliver strong across board revenue growth demand front continue momentum wafer fabrication equipment spend believe spend calendar year consistent billion estimate provide last call strength broad base foundry logic grow double digit look calendar year multiple theme underpin view continue growth include powerful market demand trend rise device complexity strong semiconductor industry operate profitability regional government support incentive market technology landscape

approximately unit revenue chamber highlight investor growth objective increase nearly year year nearly twice growth chamber count expect calendar year another strong growth year business large grow base also immense value product innovation process high volume wafer base every enable detect newly emerge challenge quickly accelerate cycle learn critical increase device manufacture complexity product front year significant milestone highlight dielectric etch system become fastest ramp etch product history build groundbreaking sense platform help customer reduce enable higher etch rate improve footprint efficiency process capability extend technology leadership high aspect ratio etch expect continue growth shipment overall revenue product roughly double year year vector product backside deposition achieve process tool record status customer device layer demonstrate leadership scale enablement achieve several important lead edge selective etch strip surface treatment solution include application gate around foundry logic customer first selective etch device complexity increase across logic memory device need level precision drive greater adoption selective etch solution compare conventional etch method enable selective etch revenue double year customer adopt innovative suite product current lead edge application future device architecture finally increase deposition market share critical application reduction qualify lead node application conclude product momentum outperformance base business great position capitalize tremendous demand wafer fabrication equipment priority alleviate near term supply constraint impact output capacity delivery predictability financial result progress expect front next several month believe calendar year another outstanding period growth thank cover financial result outlook executive vice president chief financial officer great thank good afternoon everyone thank join call today know busy earn season calendar year record year research many respect close year revenue billion include record level revenue system business also deliver time high earn share come think important point growth earn share calendar year outpace growth revenue year however bite point speak revenue come lower guidance range supply chain issue impact last week quarter delay primarily supplier critical part mean unable recognize revenue tool actually ship customer total million notice reflect increase level defer revenue balance sheet quarter billion vast majority part ship full value tool revenue march quarter continue increase output capacity factory broaden headwind global supply chain impact somewhat soft march quarter revenue gross margin guidance headwind partially omicron labor relate partially supply scale relate partially freight logistics constraint expectation broader supply chain issue industry persist exit march quarter incremental supply shipment delay potentially cause another growth much million defer revenue would highlight often ship equipment customer modular basis accelerate delivery allow customer ability begin installation wait fully configure tool supplier catch need miss component ship tool revenue future quarter obviously fluid situation right turn toward detail quarter result revenue quarter come billion slight decrease quarter increase quarter year segment perspective memory represent system

requirement market microprocessor image sensor heterogeneous silicon package technology switch regional composition total revenue region come total revenue region plus level last quarter expect outcome relate time customer investment domestic customer majority regional revenue quarter region also solid investment activity represent revenue respectively quarter revenue base business nearly billion higher quarter calendar approximately higher sequentially continue strength reflect grow base tool customer operate high utilization level ability monetize grow base offer value advance service solution subsegment record quarter want specifically call reliant product line achieve consecutive record quarter deliver value grow specialty market across numerous customer business quarterly fluctuation continue sustain stable growth annual basis move gross margin quarter midpoint guidance range increase gross margin come favorable customer product shipment time high field resource productivity greater customer installation activity discuss past gross margin fluctuate quarter quarter overall business level along customer product would mention incremental negative impact supply chain constraint discuss earlier negatively impact march gross margin guidance operate expense million increase prior quarter amount million quarter higher variable compensation close calendar

mainly focus expansion activity silicon part facility technology center open first half regular full time employee quarter quarter increase approximately people prior quarter headcount growth mainly factory field organization support grow output level look guidance march quarter expect revenue billion plus minus million discuss earlier guidance reflect expectation higher level shipment delay march quarter broaden supply chain constraint customer demand decently stronger currently supply backlog grow five consecutive quarter exit quarter expect gross margin plus minus percentage point guidance reflect higher level spend incur manage execution supply chain extra secure critical semiconductor component part today believe gross margin improve progress year forecast operate margin plus
