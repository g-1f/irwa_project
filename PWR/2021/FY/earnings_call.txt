Brian Singer -- Managing DirectorGood morning, good afternoon, good evening, everyone, and thank you for tuning into our next panel. This is one I'm very excited about, Enabling Net Zero and Infrastructure Solutions: Challenges & Opportunities. We're really happy to have two companies that are really on the front lines of enabling these solutions. From Analog Devices, Greg Henderson, Senior Vice President of Automotive and Energy, Communications and Aerospace Group; and from Quanta Services Duke Austin, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you both for joining us today.The importance of the broader supply chain to meet net zero infrastructure and clean water goals is really, really essential and we think, in fact, under-appreciated by ESG investors and investors more broadly. We've coined the term green-abler or green enabler for some of the sectors that are early on in the supply chain critical toward ultimately achieving electrification, automation, net zero infrastructure and broader clean water goals and the semiconductors, electricity transmission are two areas of focus where we think investments are going to be needed sooner, rather than later, to avoid supply chain bottlenecks in the medium-term. And I think that's why having Analog Devices with us today and having Quanta Services with us today is so important. So, Greg and Duke, welcome and thank you very much for participating in today's conversation.Earl C. Austin, Jr. -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer
