product portfolio give confidence ability meet newly increase outlook turn call senior vice president chief financial good morning everyone take minute additional perspective second quarter financial performance provide context outlook assumption strong result reflect outstanding execution across business yield revenue operate margin guidance mention especially strong exceed expectation large enterprise customer small medium size customer spend pattern perform better expect growth quarter broad base financial highlight million grow year year constant currency strong performance across customer type geography industry recur source represent total total revenue million grow constant currency exceed high guidance like revenue growth across business first half strong line performance revenue grow double digit respectively close quarter total balance defer revenue backlog million represent increase last year second quarter balance quarter continue manage business fiscal discipline yield solid second quarter gross margin operate margin better guidance operate margin positively impact revenue performance guidance time investment result second quarter also high guidance similar operate margin benefit strong revenue result time investment effective rate rate expect remainder cash flow operation total million benefit strong collection drive reduction percent receivables past partially offset difference time payment compare quarter million cash short term investment balance sheet turn topic guidance continue build confidence outlook year come strong finish initiate guidance increase revenue operate cash flow outlook full year increase reflect strong broad base financial performance second quarter current sale pipeline third quarter expect revenue range million million range mention full year raise revenue operate cash flow outlook increase full year outlook range billion billion represent growth constant currency raise full year guidance reflect performance exceed expectation increase confidence full year pipeline raise offset million dollar currency headwind result raise midpoint guidance million translate increase point constant currency growth compare guidance reminder best look full year growth quarterly growth variable mention quarterly growth rate vary strongest quarter base performance expect highest growth rate year reminder still expect growth mute give growth comparison consistent prior year dollar value highly skew toward fourth quarter expect revenue range billion billion growth constant currency similar guidance increase reflect strong revenue performance increase confidence full year pipeline offset million dollar currency headwind result raise midpoint revenue guidance million translate constant currency growth point higher midpoint guidance know introduce revenue growth volatility within quarter however full year revenue basis revenue growth variable second half expect revenue growth impact year year compare business increase full year expect range increase incorporate strong performance offset currency headwind worth note strong performance drive time investment move second half year turn full year operate cash flow guidance increase outlook range million million increase drive stronger collection expect year continue improvement payment term toward pandemic level please strong first half operate cash flow reminder second half cash flow impact whether large deal close near begin quarter model purpose expect third quarter operate margin range full year continue expect operate margin range detail around specific currency rate assumption factor outlook contain prepare remark document would like thank continue commitment customer fellow colleague prolong time uncertainty deliver exceptional execution
