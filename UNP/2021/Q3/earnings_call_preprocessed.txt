greenhouse emission quarter union pacific versus truck momentum build year plan detail emission reduction plan release initial climate action plan start morning update business environment executive vice president market good morning talk market performance want thank operate tireless effort past summer recover network forest fire focus back review business quarter volume flat compare year gain bulk industrial segment drive market strength business development effort gain offset decline premium business group serve market continue impact semiconductor chip shortage global supply chain disruption however freight revenue drive higher fuel surcharge strong price gain positive take closer look business group start bulk commodity revenue quarter compare last year drive increase volume increase average revenue reflect strong core price gain higher fuel surcharge revenue coal renewable carload grow year year second quarter effort switch customer index base contract support domestic coal demand result higher natural price couple increase coal export grain grain product compare last year second quarter primarily lower grain stock however partially offset business development effort strong demand biofuels fertilizer carload year year strong agricultural demand increase export potash shipment finally food volume flat year year sequentially second quarter move industrial industrial revenue improve quarter drive increase volume average revenue also improve drive higher fuel surcharge core price gain positive energy shipment compare last year versus second quarter gain increase petroleum product demand recover time last year business energy reform volume forest product grow year year primarily drive demand brown paper along strong house start drive lumber shipment however compare second quarter volume impact fire northern industrial chemical plastic shipment year year strengthen demand business production rate plastic improve metal mineral volume compare versus second quarter primarily drive business development effort along strong steel demand industrial market recover couple favorable comp frac sand turn premium revenue quarter decrease volume offset higher average revenue increase higher fuel surcharge core price gain automotive volume compare last year versus second quarter semiconductor shortage adverse impact finish vehicle auto part business segment intermodal volume decrease year year compare second quarter international volume continue face challenge global supply chain disruption regard domestic strong demand business also hamper supply chain disruption plus commerce business tough comp versus last year look ahead quarter start bulk commodity optimistic grain business another strong harvest grain export demand also grain product continue benefit growth biofuel market food volume positive increase consumer demand post pandemic restaurant reopen truck penetration growth lastly expect coal remain strong remainder year base current natural future inventory replenishment export demand look look industrial market continue encourage strength forecast industrial production rest positively impact many market like metal forest year year comp energy market favorable however expect narrow spread negatively impact crude rail shipment positive note expect mitigate lower cruise shipment strengthen petroleum product lastly premium anticipate continue challenge automotive relate semiconductor shortage quarter regard intermodal limit truck capacity inventory restock strength retail sale continue drive intermodal demand

restore service level customer expect deserve turn slide continue make good progress efficiency initiative however disruption quarter impact result locomotive productivity decline compare year deploy additional resource handle traffic reroutes record quarter workforce productivity drive efficiency engineer mechanical management workforce offset slightly increase train engine workforce address network recovery continue focus increase train length achieve improvement quarter approximately foot bridge restore drive productivity increase train length evidence train length growth turn slide ability grow train length also enable completion side date additional construction final plan stage investment enable reliable efficient service product future growth also produce record quarterly fuel consumption rate improve compare last year productivity initiative technology improvement able offset inefficiency stem wildfire operate department understand importance play achieve long term greenhouse emission goal work underway approach multi pronged primary emphasis around locomotive fleet look alternative energy biofuel drive productivity manage various network challenge health safety workforce paramount although year date employee safety result show improvement recent monthly trend provide positive momentum build upon approach across number front include employee engagement broader deployment technology look externally best practice additionally reduce rail equipment incident quarter encourage improvement know must maintain focus promote safe work environment reduce employee injury everyone home safe safe operation also direct impact service product work benefit stakeholder wrap slide look close utmost confidence continue improve safety increase network fluidity improve service product drive productivity support business growth customer turn review financial performance chief financial good morning hear union pacific achieve strong quarter financial result

also quarter record look closely quarter revenue slide provide breakdown freight revenue year year sequentially versus second quarter freight revenue total billion quarter compare compare second quarter look first year year analysis although volume flat overall demand environment remain strong support price action yield dollar exceed inflation year year basis gain supplement positive business drive basis point total improvement lower intermodal shipment combine higher industrial shipment drive positive fuel surcharge increase freight revenue basis point compare last year fuel surcharge program continue chase rise fuel price look freight revenue sequentially lower volume versus second quarter decrease rate revenue basis point highlight factor highlight continue core price gain positive business increase freight revenue basis point sequential basis drive combination higher industrial carload lower intermodal shipment finally rise fuel price result uptick sequential fuel surcharge increase freight revenue basis point move slide provide summary quarter operate expense increase total versus primary driver increase fuel expense result increase fuel price small offset higher price improvement fuel consumption rate better efficiency product business productivity initiative offset inefficiency associate wildfire quarter look expense line compensation benefit expense versus third quarter workforce level compare last year despite train engine workforce grow increase reflect additional crew need navigate network impact bridge outage whether management engineer mechanical workforce together decrease wage inflation along higher recrew overtime associate network issue increase employee still elevate level employee compensation increase line future expectation purchase service material expense flat higher locomotive freight maintenance associate larger active fleet offset reduce contractor expense automotive shipment forecast remain soft least balance year
