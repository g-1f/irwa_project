volume price productivity second quarter also mark important milestone quest reduce carbon footprint achieve second quarter best fuel consumption rate locomotive fuel efficiency critical element achieve goal reduce greenhouse emission help customer achieve goal eliminate million metric greenhouse emission quarter rail versus truck financial result impressive second quarter customer felt impact intermodal supply chain disruption costly rail equipment incident within intermodal space take numerous action mitigate customer impact actively work party supply chain even likely issue persist year capacity move ramp final destination fall short demand relative rail equipment incident number rate improve impact network notable effort utilize best class technology train root analysis keep crew customer community safe start update operation executive vice president good morning like begin thank entire operate department support customer many transitory challenge face first half year event impact long term real work past move slide take look performance metric quarter important note year year comparison little skew include couple historically volume month start pandemic provide comparison give little context normal seasonal volume freight velocity improve execution principle reduce freight terminal dwell improve train speed however still work return fluid network goal return metric back mile range achieve earlier year service reliability measure trip plan compliance improve time service category however current quarterly metric meet expectation customer disruption international supply chain especially intermodal space impact network significantly expense service metric choose help reduce port congestion move asset dock operation west coast port congestion move east affect inland terminal notably work proactively commercial ocean carrier customer address congestion continue sustain shipment volume port help alleviate congestion maintain fluidity also temporarily reopen global inland storage also work customer develop additional storage transportation option continue work member supply chain ocean carrier customer beneficial cargo owner port operator chassis provider dray carrier mean fluidity international freight flow first half network impact weather costly rail equipment incident make good progress reduce frequency rail incident however location couple incident occur east west main corridor sunset route notable effect intermodal manifest auto trip plan compliance measure ultimately recognize importance improve metric support customer long term growth strategy turn slide continue make good progress efficiency measure locomotive workforce productivity improve quarter improvement locomotive productivity result efficient transportation plan require fewer locomotive workforce productivity time quarterly record drive increase daily mile workforce level remain flat improvement also drive continue focus grow train link grow since second quarter foot increase consistent volume provide optionality adjust transportation plan continue focus train length efficient reliable railroad customer turn slide driver continue increase train length side extension program first half year complete seven side begin construction process additional side grow train size productivity initiative technology fuel consumption rate second quarter record improve compare last year operate department understand important role play achieve long term greenhouse emission goal wrap slide entire focus perform work safer every year
