revenue march quarter revenue sequentially compare quarter represent revenue march quarter last month gartner release microcontroller market share report calendar year gartner continue large discrepancy versus publicly report microcontroller revenue tune million revenue understatement predominantly bite microcontroller revenue category adjust gartner number actual microcontroller revenue please report microcontrollers overall remain spot however substantially close player ahead within strike distance player ahead revenue continue relentless march toward spot gain market share bite bite bite microcontroller market bite bite microcontroller business continue bite microcontroller business fastest grow microcontroller business microcontroller portfolio road never stronger believe product momentum customer engagement continue gain share build best perform microcontroller franchise industry take look business geographic perspective sequentially sequentially stronger normally seasonally strongest quarter sequentially quarter business normally year holiday take look business market perspective automotive industrial consumer market remain strongest market compute market strong data center communication market flat little aerospace defense market tend lumpy market weak business condition remain exceptionally strong quarter record book backlog product ship multiple quarter demand outpace capacity improvement able implement result lead time continue extend year semiconductor industry recall time imbalance supply demand acute response launch prefer supply program provide customer supply priority begin month order exchange least month noncancelable order customer response program exceed expectation direct customer distributor alike backlog category although almost backlog constrain capacity corridor additional backlog continue come every week give solid foundation enable prudently acquire constrain material invest expand factory capacity hire employee support factory ramp strong demand experience constraint internal external factory relate manufacture supply chain start ramp internal factory invest capital addition expand internal capacity make incremental capacity decision internal factory possible base strength backlog especially noncancelable backlog reflect fiscal year capital forecast million million also work closely supply chain partner provide wafer foundry assembly test material secure additional capacity wherever possible combination internal external capacity action take expect overall capacity continue grow every quarter calendar year capacity continue grow every quarter also believe wafer assembly test constraint persist quite likely guidance quarter backlog quarter strong addition considerable backlog request customer quarter currently later quarter despite grow capacity last quarter entire semiconductor supply chain remain constrain take factor discuss call today consideration expect sale quarter
