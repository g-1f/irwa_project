George Kurtz -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Co-Founder Thank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered an outstanding first quarter, and fiscal year 2022 is off to a record start for CrowdStrike. Building on last year's milestone performance, we started and finished the first quarter with strong momentum and results exceeding our expectations. We saw strength in multiple areas of the business, added $143.8 million in net new ARR, and grew ending ARR 74% to exceed $1.19 billion. Burt will provide the details of our financial performance, and I will focus my remarks on three key points. First, customers are increasingly turning to CrowdStrike as their trusted security cloud platform of record. As we extend the platform beyond core protection, we are seeing strong momentum in cloud workloads, IT operations, and our expansion into DevOps. Our platform includes 19 modules and easily allows customers to consolidate agents and reduce spend. Second, our leadership is recognized by both customers and industry analysts such as Gartner and Forrester. Our growing brand has become the cybersecurity gold standard translating into a broad customer base that is scaling rapidly, deeper penetration within verticals, and our strong financial success. And third, the demand environment is robust, driven by strong secular trends, including digital and security transformation, cloud adoption, and an ongoing heightened threat environment. This includes the massive influx of ransomware and the operational impact of these attacks that have been seen over the past two years. We believe these dynamics will provide CrowdStrike a runway for long-term sustainable growth. Now, let's discuss these topics in more detail. It only takes a quick glance at current headlines to know that the threat landscape is fierce and growing in intensity every day. High-profile breaches and vulnerabilities like SUNBURST, pipeline and infrastructure attacks, and zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange are only the tip of the spear. Threat actors are well resourced and becoming more sophisticated. At the same time, ransomware-as-a-service sites are making it easier for even novice e-criminals to run successful and lucrative campaigns, which is contributing to the proliferation of ransomware activity. Our 2020 CrowdStrike Global Security Attitude Survey revealed that more than half of organizations surveyed worldwide had suffered a ransomware attack within the previous 12 months. At the same time, organizations need to transform their businesses in order to keep up with evolving business needs such as work from anywhere and moving their critical applications and workloads to the cloud. Both of these factors exponentially expand the company's threat landscape and increase their risk of a breach. Today's threat environment highlights the need for organizations around the world to transform their security and adopt a Zero Trust architecture in order to protect their digital assets, identities, and core infrastructure. The lessons learned from recent attacks emphasize why legacy or perceived good-enough next-gen tech is no match for today's adversaries, leading to a crisis of trust among these vendors, whereas CrowdStrike has emerged as a trusted leader. CrowdStrike's mission to stop breaches has never been more relevant. The Falcon platform is at the epicenter of restoring trust to the security posture of companies worldwide. The integration of threat intelligence and threat hunting into the Falcon platform provides us deep insight into the adversaries and how they operate. The extensive capabilities of the Falcon platform significantly set CrowdStrike apart from both legacy and next-gen vendors. This includes our acquisition of Preempt and Humio, which could not have been more timely as companies are looking for new ways to shore up protection of their active directories, stop lateral movement and have even greater real-time visibility and search into their endpoints, identities, applications, network edge and cloud from a single data layer. Customers are increasingly turning to Zero Trust solutions to combat threat actors that leverage identity-based attacks and move laterally within their targeted environments. We won multiple Falcon Zero Trust deals in the quarter, including a global leader in auto manufacturing, a Fortune 500 manufacturer of high-tech materials and equipment, a provider of IT management software, and a municipality, among others. Additionally, when it comes to log management, companies are looking for technologies with the same characteristics as their security, reliability, scalability, speed, and real-time queries in a cost-efficient manner. Even though we just acquired Humio in March, customer interest is very high, and in Q1, we already secured new deals across multiple industries, including financial services, technology, and law enforcement. A new Humio customer that I would like to highlight is a Fortune 500 company that was using multiple legacy on-prem log management products to manage a variety of use cases across their security and dev team. In addition to the complexity of using multiple products, this company was struggling with increasing data ingestion cost. Looking to migrate to a cloud-based solution that would reduce cost, enhance visibility and be easy to implement, they chose Humio over a leading competitor in this space. Humio was selected for its index-free ingestion capabilities, faster search speeds, and customizable dashboards that provide them with greater insights in automation than any of the competitive products they evaluated. This customer is now able to meet their daily 3-terabyte data ingest needs with a single solution, allowing them to take full advantage of their data at the speed and scale of the cloud. Since our inception, driving innovation has been at the core of CrowdStrike's mission. As a result, we pioneered cloud endpoint security and have extended that to include workload protection. Our determined focus and uncompromising commitment to excellence has led to a trusted leadership position in a platform that encompasses 19 modules spanning multiple markets, including identity, XDR, and log management. Driving innovation throughout our product offering and bringing new functionality to market that leads to better and faster outcomes for our customers will continue to be a top priority. In May, we announced Falcon Fusion, a unified and extensible cloud-scale framework that provides easy-to-use custom automation to simplify enterprise security workflows and help security teams solve real-world problems with fewer resources and greater accuracy and speed. We also recently announced an expanded partnership with Google Cloud through a series of product integrations with the Falcon platform and Google Cloud's suite of security products. These integrations will help security and dev op teams increase visibility of threat actors across cloud and hybrid deployments and enable them to act much more quickly to address them. As customers have begun adopting our cloud workload protection and cloud security posture management, demand for integrations with the GCP security suite has accelerated. We are confident that the partnership with Google will drive additional value and adoption by those who are standardizing on GCP, as well as those employing a hybrid cloud strategy. We continue to extend our cloud leadership position by announcing new features to our cloud security posture management module, Falcon Horizon. These new capabilities provide security teams the ability to easily manage and protect multiple cloud environments from a single cloud-based console. Powered by CrowdStrike's industry-leading threat intelligence, Falcon Horizon is the first CSPM solution to deliver behavioral detection using IOAs of threats to the cloud control plane. Horizon utilizes an adversary-focused approach for continuous in-depth control plane threat detection across an organization's cloud accounts, services, and users for AWS and Azure. The expansion of our Falcon platform and growth of our brand leadership has brought in new customers at a rapid pace, driven incredible momentum with industry analysts and partners, and translated into strong financial results. We are gaining strong industry recognition across multiple well-respected sources. Our most recent achievements include, once again, taking a leader position in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms. In the report, we are not just in the leaders' quadrant. We are leading the pack on completeness of vision with CrowdStrike by far the furthest to the right. We believe that our position in the Magic Quadrant shows that we have clearly separated from the competition and that we in rarefied territory as a leader that continues to outpace legacy and next-gen competitors in execution, strategy, innovation, and vision. We also received the highest score for lean forward organizations in Gartner's Critical Capabilities for Endpoint Protection Platforms report. Likewise, Forrester Research named CrowdStrike a leader in endpoint security software-as-a-service in the Forrester Wave Q2 2021 report. We also received the highest scores possible within 17 criteria in the report. Forrester also named CrowdStrike a leader in both the Forrester Wave Q1 2021 Managed Detection and Response and External Threat Intelligence Services reports. We were also recognized as best cloud computing security solution and best managed security service at the 2021 SC Awards where Shawn Henry, our president of services and chief security officer, received a Security Executive of the Year award as well. Falcon achieved 100% detection coverage in all 20 steps of the MITRE ATT&CK evaluations, showcasing the effectiveness of our platform. And lastly, the Falcon platform achieved 100% protection rate in the AV-Comparatives business real-world protection test for the March-April 2021 period and the highest AAA rating in the Q1 enterprise endpoint protection evaluation from independent testing organization, SE Labs. We are proud of our continued strong track record of proven efficacy. Our participation in highly regarded industry evaluations showcase our commitment to stop breaches and drive transparency with customers. A crucial part of our commitment is to continually test our solution, validate its capabilities, and find opportunities to improve. It's unfortunate that some vendors decline to compete in these public tests, including so-called next-gen players. This lack of scrutiny is a significant disservice to all customers who would benefit from greater transparency. We believe the industry's strong recognition of CrowdStrike validates our vision, empowering organizations to embrace security transformation and stop sophisticated adversaries through the power of a cloud-native platform. We believe the rapid expansion of our partner ecosystem also demonstrates our growing leadership position. As we discussed in our webinar in April, our partner-sourced ARR grew 86% in fiscal year 2021. Partners naturally gravitate to market leaders as it helps them bring in new customers. And likewise, customer choice helps propel vendor prominence within the partner community. Our leadership position is driving strong engagement with partners of all sizes, which is contributing to our growing presence among the highest levels, including boards and CIOs. As we announced a couple of weeks ago, we strengthened our alliance with another trusted industry leader, EY. Falcon is now one of EY's preferred cybersecurity platforms. The expanded collaboration also introduces extension into new geography areas, as well as three new joint offerings. With these new offerings, we expect to leverage EY's consultants to drive CrowdStrike's subscription sales, similar to how we leverage our own professional services team, which in FY '21, on average, drove $5.51 in subscription ARR for every dollar spent on initial incident response or proactive service engagement among organizations that first became a professional services customer after February 1, 2019. Additionally, our partnership with Zscaler continues to deepen as we both invest in our technology and commercial relationship. We announced multiple new technology integrations with Zscaler this quarter and are also excited to report that they are now a CrowdStrike customer. Additionally, one of our marquee wins in the quarter was brought to us through our tech alliance with Zscaler. This Fortune 100 global insurer chose CrowdStrike to help further its digital transformation initiatives and fortify its security, replacing a patchwork of four legacy and next-gen vendors. Falcon was selected over Microsoft to replace these incumbents for its ability to consolidate multiple agents, improve performance and protect their endpoints in cloud environments with one single agent. The voice that matters most is the customers', and they are increasingly turning to CrowdStrike as their trusted security platform of record and validating our leadership. In the first quarter, we reached a new milestone as our subscription customers well surpassed the 10,000 mark. We added 1,524 net new subscription customers including the customers we acquired from Humio. On an organic basis, the net new subscription customers added in the quarter grew 69% year over year. We now proudly serve 11,420 subscription customers worldwide. Our growth across the market is very diversified as we are winning customers of all sizes and industries. In Q1, we also saw strong demand in the public sector, landing several U.S. federal wins in both civilian and defense and expansion business with the largest healthcare agency. We are optimistic in our ability to expand within these accounts over time, especially given the renewed focus to bolster the nation's cyber defenses as outlined in the White House's cybersecurity executive order. Adding customers at this rate and among companies of all sizes and verticals is not an easy task. Our go-to-market engine is executing on all fronts to seize on the strong demand we see in the market so we can help even more customers restore trust in their security posture. The investments we have made in the frictionless deployment of our platform and frictionless sales motion, which includes trial to pay and in-app trials, have never been more important. The same can be said for our strong partner ecosystem with leading partners like AWS and EY. These advantages minimize barriers to adoption expand our reach and shorten the sales process, which we believe provides us an edge over the competition. We believe we can execute on market demand faster than any other vendor, whereas even next-gen competitors struggle with a complex sales process and even more complex deployments that are difficult to scale out of the lab. Our growing leadership at the trusted security partner of choice is also reflected in our continued success in driving module adoption. Subscription customers that have adopted four or more modules, five or more modules, and six or more modules increased to 64%, 50%, and 27%, respectively, in the first quarter. We are growing our footprint to cover more customer assets with new and existing customers alike. This includes adoption of newer technologies such as Falcon Cloud runtime protection, Zero Trust, and Humio. In the last quarter, we more than doubled ARR from our newly launched cloud workload modules. We are rapidly scaling our overall cloud footprint with greater than 20% of all servers we protect being in the public cloud. We are also expanding our DevOps capabilities and seeing success selling into DevOps environments as we continue to help customers reduce their attack surface and unify cloud security posture management and breach protection. Let me share a few customer examples that demonstrate how the power of the Falcon platform translated into strategic customer wins. A Q1 deal I'd like to highlight was an expansion with Cloudera, a cloud-native, enterprise data company that provides insights using machine learning and analytics. Viewing effective security as essential to their operations, Cloudera has been a CrowdStrike customer for their traditional endpoints for multiple years. Looking to further leverage the CrowdStrike Falcon platform to protect their ephemeral cloud environment, Cloudera purchased a fully managed solution for Falcon Horizon, Cloud Workload Protection, Discover for Cloud and Container, and Falcon Complete to provide them with a fully managed and hassle-free solution. Our next customer win is with a Fortune 150 multinational manufacturing company. After trying to deploy Microsoft Defender for over a year, they found themselves frustrated with the level of complexity and the cumbersome agents, resulting in less than a third of their endpoints protected. On top of that, the recent zero-day Microsoft Exchange vulnerability has exposed them to risk of a potential breach, and they would have to wait months before Microsoft could deliver a patch to fully resolve the issue. This is when they turned to CrowdStrike. With our single lightweight agent that doesn't require a reboot, this new customer found Falcon easy to deploy, fast and effective. As a result, they purchased five modules and deployed globally in a matter of weeks. The last customer win I will share with you is a healthcare services provider. This new customer was looking to quickly move off their SentinelOne implementation after experiencing several outages caused by sensor updates impacting their critical business operations. Frustrated at the lack of scalability, need for manual updates, and continuous crashes with SentinelOne, this customer chose CrowdStrike over other providers including Carbon Black and Palo Alto Networks. Falcon outshined the competition given its ease of use and frictionless, fast, and reboot-less deployment. Purchasing eight modules, including Spotlight, Horizon, and Discover for Cloud and Containers, Falcon is now protecting their multi-OS estate of traditional endpoints, as well as their previously unprotected cloud workloads. In summary, the fundamental reasons why we have earned our leadership position and are winning customers at a rapid pace over both legacy and next-gen vendors are the Falcon platform's ability to fully utilize the power of the cloud and AI to stop breaches and provide community immunity; our ability to easily and rapidly deploy our lightweight agent at scale across both endpoints and workloads without requiring a reboot, while other next-gen vendors fail to scale and require reboots; our platform is easy to use and easy to manage all from a single user interface; and our ability to leverage the power of the cloud to collect data once and solve many real-world business problems that deliver better outcomes and immediate ROI for customers. Customers recognize that Threat Graph and our ability to stream data to the cloud in real time are unique to CrowdStrike. This is very different from other vendors, including upstarts that silo their data and upload data in delayed batches. Any vendor with an on-prem solution is currently unable to fully utilize the power of the cloud. With one data store, CrowdStrike analyzes data almost instantaneously across our entire customer base, providing real-time protection, community immunity, and better training data for our AI algorithms. This allows us to deepen our competitive moat. While a robust demand environment may serve as a temporary lifeline to inferior technologies, when I look at the competitive landscape, I couldn't be more confident in our leadership position. I do not see another vendor in the market with our vision, platform, scale, or ability to execute at scale. Our leadership as a trusted security platform of record and strong financial performance stands as a testament that CrowdStrike's dedication to innovation, protecting customers, and transforming the security industry. I'd like to thank every CrowdStriker for all that they do day in and day out to make us the best in the business. With that, I will turn the call over to Burt to discuss our financial results in more detail.Burt Podbere -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. Before we get started, I will note that the results we are reporting today include the acquisition of Humio. To assist with your models, we will share select details regarding Humio's impact on Q1. However, we do not intend to disclose these details on an ongoing basis. The acquired net new ARR from Humio was approximately $3.6 million, which is reflected in both the ending and net new ARR results we are reporting today. From the acquisition of Humio, we also gained 119 net new customers in the quarter. Given the acquisition closed during the quarter and the impact of fair value purchase accounting adjustments related to deferred revenue, the GAAP revenue recognized from Humio was de minimis to our results. The acquisition also added approximately $5 million to operating expenses in the quarter, which again represents about two months of quarterly expenses. Moving to our results. We delivered an exceptional first quarter. In addition to strong growth at scale in the first quarter, we continue to maintain very high unit economics, drive leverage and remain very capital efficient, generating record operating and free cash flow. Additionally, we continue to perform at a high level, well in excess of the SaaS industry's Rule of 40 benchmark, achieving a Rule of 80. Demand in the quarter was broad-based and fueled by strength in multiple areas of the business. Similar to last quarter, demand for our solutions was well balanced between new customers and expansion business and between large enterprises and mid-market and smaller accounts. We once again ended the quarter with a record pipeline, which we believe indicates a strong foundation for future growth. In the quarter, we delivered 74% ARR growth year over year to reach $1.19 billion. In the last 12 months, we have added more than $0.5 billion to ARR. Rapid new customer acquisition, as well as expansion business within existing customers, drove substantial growth in the first quarter, once again resulting in very strong net new ARR, which came in at $143.8 million. Our dollar-based net retention rate once again exceeded 120%. Moving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 70% over Q1 of last year to reach $302.8 million. Subscription revenue grew 73% over Q1 of last year to reach $281.2 million. Professional services revenue was $21.6 million, setting a new record for the third consecutive quarter and representing 36% year-over-year growth. In terms of our geographic performance in Q1, we continue to see strong growth in the U.S., as well as international markets. Revenue growth in the U.S. increased to 70% and contributed approximately 73% of first-quarter revenue. Approximately 14% of revenue was derived from Europe, Middle East, and Africa markets; 10% from Asia Pacific; and approximately 3% from other markets. We remain focused on building a long-term business with sustainable growth and compelling margins. In Q1, we recognized strong operating leverage in our SaaS model and the benefits of scale even as we increased investments in our global reach and cloud platform. First-quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 77%, up approximately 150 basis points from Q1 of last year. Our non-GAAP subscription gross margin was 79% compared with 78% in Q1 of last year. We continue to be pleased with our strong subscription gross margin performance. While we expect gross margin to fluctuate quarter to quarter, we expect it to remain solidly within our increased target model range of 77% to 82% or more as we march to fiscal year 2025. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter were $202.9 million or 67% of revenue versus $133.0 million last year or 75% of revenue. As planned, we continued investing aggressively in our business during the quarter, including increasing investments in new technologies, international geographies, and marketing programs. We believe the investments we are making today will lead to sustained growth over the long term and maintain our pole position as the trusted security partner of choice. Scaling our business efficiently remains a top priority, which is why we intensely focus on our unit economics, including Magic Number. In Q1, we ended with a Magic Number of 1.4, which is an increase over last quarter and indicates that we should continue investing in our large and growing market opportunity. First-quarter non-GAAP operating income was $29.8 million, and operating margin improved 9 percentage points over Q1 of last year to reach 10%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike in Q1 was $23.3 million or $0.10 on a diluted-per-share basis. Our weighted average common shares used to calculate first-quarter non-GAAP EPS attributable to CrowdStrike was on a diluted basis and totaled 237 million shares. We ended the first quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $1.68 billion. This takes into account the $352 million net cash consideration we invested to acquire Humio. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter grew to $147.5 million and free cash flow increased to $117.3 million or 39% of revenue, setting new records for both measures. As a reminder, given the timing of expenses, seasonality of new hires, and the midyear ESPP purchase, the second quarter is generally our lowest cash flow generation quarter. Moving to our guidance. We continue to remain optimistic about the demand for our offerings, record pipeline, and the powerful secular trends fueling our growth. Given the growth drivers of our business, as well as our exceptional first-quarter performance and momentum into the second quarter, we are raising our guidance for the fiscal year 2022. While we do not specifically guide to ending or net new ARR, we expect seasonality in net new ARR to be less pronounced relative to prior years as we move from Q1 into Q2 given the outstanding outperformance in Q1. Additionally, recall that in Q2 of last year, net new ARR included the second-largest deal in the company's history, which contributed low-eight figures to ARR. For the second quarter of FY '22, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $318.3 million to $324.4 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 60% to 63% with subscription revenue being the dominant driver of growth. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $26.3 million to $30.7 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $17.7 million to $22.1 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $0.07 and $0.09, utilizing a weighted average share count of 238 million shares on a diluted basis. For the full fiscal year 2022, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $1,347.0 million to $1,365.7 million reflecting a growth rate of 54% to 56% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $115.7 million and $129.6 million. We expect fiscal 2022 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $83.1 million and $97.0 million. Utilizing 239 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.41. George and I will now take your questions.
