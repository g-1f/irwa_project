ford could always relationship experience customer better better time build foundational strength iconic product uniquely appeal vehicle manufacture excellence industry best captive finance company capability talent invest business accelerate value create customer investor commit deliver richer experience ford customer improve time thing like software upgrade data drive experience productivity uptime service critical commercial customer charge software ford also mean introduce industry high volume electric vehicle lineup invest capital human resource require design build world class battery electric powertrain component position launch autonomous people good delivery business significant future growth potential fundamental transform ford strengthen auto operation also expand addressable market commitment earn confidence strong execution quarter quarter year year deliver solid return regardless challenge face external environment like second quarter despite many headwind semiconductor shortage unique ford skillfully manage business generate positive tell outcome certain begin quarter require intense focus price primary advantage right strength product portfolio stronger stop make
