large market launch carbon solution business evaluate advance plan opportunity around world last week introduce concept multi industry capture store emission heavy industry around ship channel think carbon capture innovation zone similar enterprise zone incentive policy design encourage economic growth smart advance idea help bring together government incentive private sector investment along policy regulation would encourage innovation ideal location major project plant along heavily ship channel represent hardest sector decarbonize also relatively close together provide project scale reduce unit proximity also provide direct access suitable storage location department energy estimate geology beneath capacity safely store entire country currently produce next year currently envision project could capture million metric year twice would reach goal become carbon neutral concept need support many different party private public regulatory legal support level government crucial establish incentive attract investment federal government already provide carbon reduction incentive credit electric vehicle wind solar enhance credit establish market price carbon emission combine appropriate rule oversight would accelerate solution long talk importance innovation multi user concept example look take large complex challenge find solution help meet society demand lower
