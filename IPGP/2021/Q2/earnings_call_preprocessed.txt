demonstrate excellent progress core material process market across major geography accelerate growth high power ultra high power laser application strong growth weld also deliver robust growth emerge product application revenue material process application increase year year contribute total revenue quarter sale weld application grow significantly last several quarter increase sale adjust motor beam laser general manufacture purpose electric vehicle battery weld application battery manufacturer face challenge weld together different type material kind copper sulfur aluminum material extremely reflective need weld high precision reliability battery model require hundred weld laser address challenge offer superior speed weld quality competence solution broad range beam tunability weld also strong demand emerge micro material process application solar cell manufacture print sale green pulse laser improve solar efficiency triple compare prior year become meaningful part revenue take advantage opportunity create increase focus sustainability globally expect future solar cell manufacture capacity grow drive additional sale green laser also increase pulse energy green laser enable next generation application solar drill copper weld consumer electronics revenue application increase year year medical sale show good growth year year sequentially result improve demand surgical laser advance application sale improve year year telecom revenue decline compare period prior year examine performance region revenue increase year year second quarter represent approximately total sale year year comparison region difficult sale rebound pandemic earlier region last year strong demand weld application ultra high power laser demand translate quarter sale high power laser increase slightly compare second quarter last year continue solid demand foil weld application relate electric vehicle battery also start demand compare weld system provide modest benefit revenue second half market remain price competitive continue discipline approach price give superior performance quality energy efficiency reliability power laser remain significant part customer base focus price alone sale rest increase year year strong growth country offset lower revenue strong demand weld foil solution battery encourage improve book revenue increase year year acceleration demand customer region strong growth weld mark clean application sale improve significantly high power ultra high power laser customer move ultra high power laser replace laser fiber laser improve productivity book region remain positive point continue recovery revenue north increase year year growth primarily drive material process increase sale high power laser application sale automotive traditional electrical solar market remain strong also solid improvement micro material process application strong growth demand besides normal direct sale model leverage third party resale numerous weld store direct online sale platform laser system sale improve second quarter laser laser system post strong revenue growth book remain high expect additional improvement system sale third quarter continue benefit vertically integrate production model enable technology advantage competition minimize supply chain disruption however experience focus certain component quarter increase lead time impact customer operation also evaluate inflationary pressure input deviate prior expire despite trouble year able deliver revenue growth midpoint guidance gross margin close expectation second quarter technology leader fiber laser year none competitor able match approach capability product restructure development continue focus reduce improve quality component product also commit expand

second quarter book bill remain expect continue improvement sale outside sale likely moderate third quarter difficult comparison softer demand application however displacement laser technology secular environmental trend investment make emerge product mean continue growth opportunity high power foil weld application electric vehicle battery production opportunity solar cell manufacture medical procedure advance application also sale gain traction multiple geography second half year third quarter expect revenue million million imply year year growth midpoint despite difficult third quarter
