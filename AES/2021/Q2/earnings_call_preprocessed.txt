average annual growth adjust parent free cash flow give color accomplishment cover follow three theme show slide growth transformation utility rapidly grow renewables business three strategic advantage innovation recall investor march outline plan invest billion transform utility second quarter conclude outstanding regulatory proceed utility clear path investment latest technology enable deliver higher level service reduce carbon emission core effort focus deep understand digital tool vastly improve customer experience enable integration orchestration diverse distribute renewable resource start slide expect nearly double rate base grow annually recently make substantial headway outstanding regulatory file first commission approve stipulation allow predictable cash flow investment smart grid initiative next four year second also receive approval regulate formulary allow recovery transmission investment move slide invest billion next five year part grid modernization program transition renewables base generation recently receive regulatory approval megawatt hill solar project announce agreement acquire solar project include megawatt solar megawatt hour energy storage expect grow rate base annually many regulatory approval behind position execute utility modernization decarbonization program year make turn second theme renewables growth slide last year record break year renewable contract gigawatt sign year already sign almost gigawatt contract wind solar energy storage nearly double amount time last year contract toward achieve exceed target gigawatts time customer negotiate bilateral basis project yield return project level line teen average high teen internationally progress year include recent agreement acquire megawatt operate wind asset show slide state supportive renewables policy combine scarcity wind project northeast provide several pathway long term attractive cash flow support repowering wind acquisition complement solar energy storage pipeline provide another resource offer diversify differentiate product consumer turn slide particularly please ability advance clean energy product year announce world first ever large scale carbon free energy hourly basis supply data center concept real time renewable generation oppose purchase offset renewable credit highest standard clean energy since replicate similar structure large scale customer help achieve sustainability target support renewables growth goal total gigawatts clean energy product sign award thus year innovative carbon free energy product example unique advantage technical commercial ability culture work together customer understand specific need turn slide nearly gigawatts renewables energy storage project year backlog gigawatt include gigawatts currently construction expect bring gigawatts online remainder strength renewables growth rapidly expand market support achieve goal earn renewables utility earn also continue aggressively grow pipeline early late stage development project support future growth slide pipeline gigawatts among largest world pipeline include gigawatts hottest market country decarbonization slide last month announce gigawatts coal fire generation would voluntarily retire soon replace gigawatt newly contract renewable since announce sale retirement almost gigawatts coal fire generation among largest program company please report exit along substantial renewable addition reduce generation coal approximately total generation forma basis additional reduction percentage point since last quarter would like address concern hear investor relate growth renewables inflationary pressure supply chain bottleneck largest global renewable developer strong reputation long history successfully negotiate strategic supply agreement result preferential access price furthermore lock hardware price sign shelter future price fluctuation equipment need gigawatt backlog already secure feel comfortable ability execute strong pipeline short medium term turn slide third theme innovation entire sector continue rapidly evolve increasingly find competitive advantage able effectively incorporate technology business model example benefit significantly energy storage business start year largest industry important synergy core business technology venture example year half renewables energy include energy storage component last month award highest honor power utility sector award electric institute work develop energy storage effective alternative plant specifically award battery energy storage system consist megawatt hour energy storage supply power thousand home seventh award overall third award last decade would like note many award company recent year turn slide also continue build prior success create technology example previously mention strategic investment solar solution company patent technology allow solar project build third time half much land resistant hurricane force wind continue grow footprint across several market include expand work domestic partner establish local manufacture hope enable reach much greater scale much quickly combine lead work robotics construction help lower solar advance learn curve turn slide similarly continue benefit investment provide cloud base energy efficiency solution million household business numerous utility customer include close previously announce transaction electric group investor value billion conclusion please progress date across strategic initiative position achieve financial goal track transformational target earn renewables utility generation coal turn call executive vice president chief financial good morning everyone mention make excellent progress year already achieve significant milestone strategic financial objective please continue economic recovery across market drive reopen local economy many client continue benefit record steel copper indecipherable price result significant improvement electricity demand across business also reflect sale outstanding remain historically level turn financial result second quarter slide adjust primarily reflect execution growth plan demand recovery utility parent interest save positive driver partially offset lower contribution slightly higher adjust rate turn slide adjust contribution million quarter increase million versus second quarter driver second quarter result detail begin slide utility strategic business unit million drive primarily demand recovery utility higher contribution gigawatt renewable asset commencement power purchase agreement energy turn slide encourage material recovery consistent demand utility weather normalize basis demand demand combine volume largely back level recovery mainly drive higher load commercial industrial customer year result reopen local business separately gigawatt legacy unit position contribute state press energy need transition sustainable carbon free future fact state water board consider energy agency recommendation megawatt beach facility extend year align remain legacy unit propose extension would upside expectation turn back quarterly result slide south lower mostly drive recovery expense customer lower equity earn also drier hydrology impact partially offset higher generation hydro plant higher central primarily reflect better hydrology partially offset sale finally remain relatively flat impact sale largely offset lower interest expense turn slide first half result track achieve full year adjust guidance discuss past typical quarterly earn profile back weight roughly earn occur first half year growth year primarily drive gigawatts renewables asset come online remainder year continue demand recovery across market reduce interest expense save benefit
