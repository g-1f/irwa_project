currently posture however believe propose requirement prohibitive patient overly burdensome costly company duplicative data generate ongoing trial exist require post market requirement believe best address concern supplement data aduhelm phase study generate data patient take multipronged approach leverage confirmatory study envision embark study approximately patient ongoing registry ongoing phase study antibody class ongoing anticipate real world data generation effort believe extensive data generation opportunity adequately address open question regard clinical efficacy safety amyloid beta lower therapy note expect begin patient screen envision study year primary completion date anticipate approximately four year later expect global placebo control trial enroll patient disease mild disease confirmation amyloid beta pathology plan primary point month plan long term extension month believe study combine study mention address question raise therefore continue advocate provide rapid equitable patient access provide coverage patient identify appropriate treatment approve label generally align phase clinical trial population also believe multipronged approach allow equal access community concern restriction propose would unfairly exclude access patient underserved community geographically remote area contrast expect envision registry seek enroll participant obtain
