represent significant step forward goal transform biogen company build upon multi franchise portfolio across broad spectrum neuroscience therapeutic area would like turn call detail update progress detail update progress head research like start word aducanumab accelerate approval aducanumab generate discussion reflect broad range opinion include efficacy selection accelerate approval path regulatory process general since make several clarify statement topic always defer lead voice matter independent regulatory body charge weigh data expertly order make critical decision potential impact million people think would helpful perspective several topic include interaction agency proud work dedicate develop aducanumab hope bring patient disease equally proud professionalism demonstrate lengthy process therefore welcome formal review interaction biogen path approval aducanumab better understand fact good everyone involve assure confidence therapy process approve cooperate fully review even prioritize issue affect patient want underscore normal appropriate scientist clinician data experiment clinical trial debate disagree interpretation data science advance welcome discussion however would like correct misinformation recently first several people state anti amyloid antibody clear amyloid brain factually incorrect first generation anti amyloid antibody solanezumab specific aggregate form beta target soluble beta deficient effector function result antibody clear amyloid brain slide show amyloid image result peer review literature first generation antibody solanezumab significant difference placebo amyloid plaque burden show significant difference placebo phase trial largely drive unexplained increase amyloid plaque burden placebo treat patient mild moderate stage disease believe increase amyloid plaque placebo patient must result know plaque buildup reach maximum time patient mild cognitive impairment short evidence first generation antibody beta actually remove amyloid plaque basis failure antibody reason approve aducanumab also statement aducanumab result post also factually incorrect primary secondary endpoint specify phase trial protocol statistical analysis plan first patient trial aducanumab label show result specify endpoint base data already collect site time trial prematurely terminate march separately contend lead unblinding take great care ensure clinical outcome measure know occurrence assure unblinding affect result examine clinical outcome effective blind result might expect change slide show result exclude data obtain event overall result thus confident unblinding affect result phase trial aducanumab finally people approval aducanumab would inhibit development drug disease statement precedent prime example history drug approval lymphoma multiple sclerosis name neurology first medicine ever approve beta interferon receive accelerate approval within next several year type beta interferon approve control clinical trial show slow progression disability today drug approve treatment reduce risk relapse slow progression disability molecular entity approve base control clinical trial continue conduct nearly year accelerate approval beta interferon believe similar situation start unfold disease come year data become available phase trial several second generation antibody capable effectively remove amyloid plaque also result post market trial aducanumab data address residual uncertainty surround efficacy class meantime main serious risk associate aducanumab base data phase

aducanumab experience symptomatic serious symptom report patient disease fatal death people additional clinical study confirm class drug effective slow clinical decline mention patient lack access aducanumab longer appropriate treatment discuss aducanumab data many month aducanumab approve unite state data summarize clearly label hope doctor benefit risk take aducanumab patient caregiver base rational analysis accurate information provide information prescribe community number first continue present scientific forum publish analysis phase trial aducanumab focus publish primary manuscript additional data inform clinical practice include management include four presentation plan conference next week second move sense urgency finalize design aducanumab post market confirmatory phase control study intend verify clinical benefit aducanumab disease still work detail actively engage regulator goal execute study expeditiously possible ahead post market commitment approximately nine year third unique data generation opportunity embark embark long term extension study month last patient trial bring total enrollment study roughly disease patient year embark study include patient previously treat aducanumab approximately year thereby generate important long term safety efficacy data aducanumab plan present embark baseline data upcoming medical meet yield important insight effect treatment interruption longer term impact reduce amyloid plaque potential benefit continue treatment lastly plan initiate real world observational study disease call order collect real world long term effectiveness safety data aducanumab also evaluate additional formulation aducanumab goal increase patient confidence last month initiate phase study evaluate bioavailability subcutaneous formulation aducanumab continue engage regulator appropriate development strategy finally continue advance innovative pipeline potential disease treatment include lecanemab anti amyloid antibody collaborate lecanemab recently award breakthrough therapy designation work engage pursue optimum regulatory pathway also look forward readout clarity phase study lecanemab expect next year addition anti amyloid approach also target primary component neurofibrillary another hallmark disease although learn phase study early disease meet primary secondary endpoint believe result diminish relevance
