Thank you, May, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our President and CEO, Greg Becker; and our CFO, Dan Beck, are here to talk about our first quarter 2021 financial results, and they'll be joined by other members of our management team for the Q&A. Our current earnings release, highlight slides and CEO letter have been filed with the SEC and are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. We'll be making forward-looking statements during this call, and actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call.In addition, some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release. And now I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Greg Becker.Gregory W. Becker -- President, Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThanks, Meghan, and thank you all for joining us today. As you can see from our earnings announcement and slides, which we filed a few hours ago, SVB had a great quarter of exceptional growth and profitability, and it was our best quarter in history and we're notably increasing our outlook for 2021. Our Q1 performance was marked by continued outstanding balance sheet growth, strong net interest income, incredible warrant and investment gains, outstanding SVB Leerink revenue, solid core fees and stable credit overall. So we'd like to go right into Q&A, and I'm going to ask the operator to open up the lines.
