please ahead chairman chief executive officer thank think problem line last look welcome first pfizer earn call chief investor relation officer hello everyone proud pfizer deliver outstanding second quarter notably deliver extremely strong financial result even exclude direct line even exclude direct sale alliance revenue provide vaccine generate operational revenue growth compare prior year quarter would note year quarter also strong deliver operational growth comparable business time continue accelerate production delivery pfizer vaccine collaboration ship billion since last truly remarkable especially consider prior pandemic pfizer produce approximately million annually across entire vaccine portfolio start commentary biggest growth driver quarter pfizer vaccine contribute billion global revenue second quarter continue sign agreement government around world last week announce government purchase additional million vaccine bring total number supply government exist supply agreement million addition million agree provide government profit price donate poorest country world anticipate significant amount remain vaccine manufacture capacity deliver middle income country price line income level profit price fact track deliver commitment provide year billion approximately total production middle income county another billion revenue operationally million globally disease educational effort continue support increase appropriate diagnosis main driver growth successful establishment several referral network select area result patient start anticipate effort continue support strong trajectory franchise continue strong performance revenue operationally billion lead growth emerge market drive primarily strength clinical profile ease patient clinician continue increase adoption valvular atrial fibrillation overall oral anticoagulant market share gain overall million growth primarily higher level healthcare activity wellness visit compare prior year

partially offset continue impact lower remain eligible unvaccinated population quarter food drug administration approve adult prevention invasive disease pneumonia cause pneumococcal serotypes vaccine would note valent vaccine also recently receive approval adult however approval include pneumonia case believe indication valent vaccine conduct post licensure efficacy effectiveness trial believe mean foreseeable future likely vaccine indication vaccine type pneumonia serotypes continue please double digit growth international market encourage sign recovery several market continue lead inhibitor total patient share share first line metastatic patient start total prescription volume stable second quarter demand increase enrollment patient assistance program reference last quarter result second quarter revenue decline compare year quarter global revenue operational million primarily reflect increase adoption develop combination certain immune checkpoint inhibitor million drive strong demand across approve indication global biosimilars revenue grow operationally million drive several recent oncology biosimilar launch biosimilars become meaningful part business deliver lower patient care option help reduce overall healthcare spend level share brief update inhibitor portfolio continue remain confident importance inhibitor class appropriate patient inflammatory disease give

order promote competition believe better alternative policy forward executive order agree foster competition lower patient focus regulatory legislative action continue support affordable option patient like biosimilars improve medical program pocket also lower save senior make insurance work require patient share rebate save pharmacy counter believe meaningful solution would immediate impact patient without sacrifice future innovation overall believe second quarter clear part demonstration capability pfizer look forward intend build upon success continue follow science trust people remain

vaccine viral load leave side reduce drastically disease severity right side base overwhelmingly positive data accelerate development vaccine adult plan initiate global phase three trial third quarter hope conclude study swiftly part recent spike infection report swift delivery world first base vaccine make scientific opportunity technology clear strategy advance unlock full potential focus three core area strengthen core vaccine franchise grow infectious disease vaccine pipeline explore therapeutic area like rare disease oncology strongest potential start vaccine begin work vaccine much better efficacy better cell innate immune response timely manufacture soon strain know could dramatically change trajectory disease project start first human trial modify vaccine third quarter subject regulatory approval preclinical study perform first generation modify tetravalent vaccine data compare data market vaccine immunogenicity mouse first generation candidate across northern hemisphere strain higher high subunit vaccine encourage data look forward progress program turn vaccine program collaboration delta variant transmissible expand rapidly worldwide represent approximately sequence case continue believe likely third dose booster need within month full vaccination maintain highest level protection study underway evaluate safety immunogenicity third dose ongoing discussion regulatory agency regard potential third dose boost current vaccine assume positive result anticipate emergency authorization submission early pending regulatory approval also plan start immunogenicity safety study evaluate update version vaccine specifically design target delta variant show initial data small number patient receive third dose exist vaccine observe significant boost utilize antibody follow third dose current vaccine wild type beta variant month post dose antibody level start decline earlier initial analysis third dose give month second dose neutralize antibody five time higher wild type time higher beta variant primary third dose elevate neutralize antibody laboratory study higher level post dose three compare dose three analysis neutralize antibody original phase three trial level older population comparable younger population show break data small number participant third dose boost current vaccine neutralize titer test delta variant fivefold post dose younger people fold post dose older people receive third dose month vaccination protection begin wane estimate potentially boost neutralize antibody titer participant study time higher post dose three compare dose three preliminary data encourage delta continue spread finally turn potentially first class antiviral protease inhibitor successful protease inhibitor potential provide patient oral therapy could prescribe five treatment course first sign infection patient critical care patient close contact someone contract study five post exposure prophylaxis course goal reduce viral load thereby hopefully decrease prevent symptom minimize risk hospitalization initiate phase trial evaluate efficacy safety tolerability orally protease inhibitor participant successful project potential emergency authorization submission fourth quarter protease inhibitor exhibit potent selective vitro antiviral activity coronaviruses potentially currently know variant also demonstrate robust preclinical antiviral effect cell animal enable selectivity time higher coronavirus protease human protease chart leave show robust dose dependent reduction disease score mouse phase human study today desirable drug exposure good tolerability safety find dose milligram twice healthy volunteer chart right phase study show high drug exposure entire treatment period exceed greater five time exposure predict inhibit viral replication conclude review eight select breakthrough program among many come decade turn frank frank chief financial officer thank know release provide highlight regard
