everyone prouder pfizer start first quarter deliver strong financial result even exclude revenue provide vaccine revenue grow operationally report growth include negative impact price continue accelerate production shipment vaccine many case exceed contractual obligation delivery timeline achieve several important clinical regulatory commercial milestone start commentary biggest growth driver quarter pfizer vaccine contribute billion global revenue first quarter pfizer along partner ship approximately million vaccine country territory around world share think sustainability revenue stream later remark continue deliver strong performance revenue operationally billion first quarter sale growth drive mainly strong volume growth generate revenue million represent operational growth disease education effort continue support appropriate diagnosis increase estimate diagnosis rate almost quarter quarter patient diagnose patient receive prescription patient receive drug include patient receive drug patient assistance program still regional difference cardiology activity elective diagnostic procedure guideline national basis diagnosis rate recover exceed level compare first quarter also strong growth develop largest contributor revenue outside also perform global revenue operationally million growth primarily drive growth growth operationally international develop market underlie prescription demand grow compare first quarter outpace advance therapy market percentage point invest formulary access play vital role enable volume growth revenue decline compare year quarter total prescription volume relatively stable continue lead product class wide range total patient share first line however increase enrollment quarter patient assistance program provide free charge certain income patient believe increase relate economic hardship affect particularly demographic patient population expect normalize time economic impact pandemic subside contract approximately billion vaccine expect deliver result base contract sign increase revenue guidance expect revenue approximately billion vaccine also ongoing discussion multiple country around world need expect discussion lead additional supply agreement base believe durable demand vaccine similar vaccine likely outcome want long term partner health authority around world ongoing effort combat include plan ongoing pandemic vaccination approach purpose local requirement together partner expect capacity manufacture least billion discussion number country around world multiyear contract potential supply vaccine beyond fact recently sign agreement supply million additional supply million enough government boost every eligible citizen subject local guideline option purchase million additional additional booster also reach agreement supply million option supply million additional hope pfizer vaccine continue global impact help pandemic control help economy around world open stay open create scenario pfizer continue leader beneficiary realize goal continue lead strong science maximize impact vaccine prevent disease also work develop potential novel protease inhibitor administer
