aviation market show continue sign recovery contribute quarter focus continuous improvement lean drive broader operational financial progress time manage significant challenge today start number slide order robust growth segment service equipment reflect continue demand technology solution better commercial execution industrial revenue continue strength service organically aviation improve significantly benefit market recovery equipment organically largely supply chain disruption ford ventilator comparison healthcare expect lower power equipment adjust industrial margin expand basis point organically largely drive operational improvement many business growth higher margin service aviation power restructure benefit adjust significantly drive industrial industrial free cash flow billion discontinue factor program better earn work capital short term favorable time impact aircraft delivery delay overall encourage performance especially aviation share give give confidence first result reflect significant improvement near term market fundamental departure trend better recover level expect acceleration traffic continue travel restriction lift vaccination rate increase result also reflect operate improvement example aviation overhaul shop lean increase turnaround time nearly decrease shop inventory level since fourth quarter improvement enable engine back customer faster lower business better position aviation support customer come cycle ready industry largest youngest fleet continue invest next generation lower carbon technology rise program platform generate value decade come also clearly navigate headwind close year look feel impact supply chain disruption many business largest impact date healthcare base broader industry trend expect companywide pressure continue least first half next year work diligently increase supply activate dual source qualify alternative part redesign product configuration expand factory capacity also focus margin deploy lean decrease inventory implement appropriate price action reduce select discount example experience higher customer demand make production even efficient help offset challenge delay input value stream standard work quarterly reduce production lead time part receive year line sight another reduction year single example within healthcare take together effort time renewables encourage administration commitment offshore wind development however onshore wind pending production credit extension create uncertainty customer cause much market activity preparation share blanket extension intend policy unintended consequence push investment decision business give order revenue impact continue fourth quarter environment along inflation headwind pick next year make renewables ongoing work improve productivity even urgent give take expect revenue flat year drive change business outlook cover moment importantly even lower revenue raise margin expectation underscore improve profitability service growth reflect strengthen operation narrow free cash flow range around exist midpoint look next year business continue strengthen expect revenue growth margin expansion higher free cash flow despite pressure manage currently provide detail usual fourth quarter earn outlook call move slide challenge aside performance reflect continue progress journey become focus simpler stronger high industrial combination tremendous catalyst enable focus industrial core accelerate deleveraging plan last week satisfy regulatory clearance transaction target close proceed reduce debt expect reach approximately

debt reduction approximately billion consideration give deleveraging progress cash flow improvement date plus expect action better performance expect total reduction approximately billion since receive equity stake world lead aviation monetize aviation industry continue recover share expect near term leverage remain elevate remain commit debt reduction leverage target next year liquidity quarter billion cash continue significant improvement lower cash need currently billion billion quarter take decrease reduce factor better work capital management important proof point able operate lower predictable cash need create opportunity high return investment move business also speak organic basis first aviation improve result reflect significantly stronger market departure trend recover early pickup begin continue better departure customer confidence contribute higher shop visit spare part sale initially anticipate impact green time utilization also lessen expect positive trend
