continue grow especially industrial side chemical electric vehicle lithium iron phosphate battery demand side expect global shipment potash phosphate availability affordability consumption force adjust available supply north weather indicate possibility compress application season grower remain incentivized maximize yield today crop price offset input suggest farmer profitability second highest level decade similarly grower economics also improve thank rise soybean price farmer demand nutrient remain strong thank another good monsoon season strong global grain price availability still response stronger grower demand historically domestic inventory last week government increase fertilizer subsidy positive development help meet though likely significant demand look business context today global market remain optimistic potash ramp initially target million tonne year complete logistical constraint winter weather impact first quarter shipment production issue appear largely behind addition march rail constraint force temporary curtailment back online operate expand rate million tonne initial target million tonne second quarter expect sale volume million million tonne realize price second quarter expect tonne higher realize price first quarter phosphate expect recovery volume material escalate supply meet production target ammonia continue benefit significant advantage thank internal production supply agreement industry first quarter ammonia need meet tonne link directly inaudible shield price swing global ammonia market result first quarter ammonia roughly half benchmark price second quarter expect phosphate sale volume million million tonne expect sale volume reflect improvement logistics delay somewhat offset inventory historic level second

high return modest investment area like footprint expansion investment soil health biologics recent disruption global fertilizer supply situation believe could extend time also actively explore debottlenecking opportunity increase fertilizer production quickly possible potash already raise annual rate million tonne initial restart target million tonne path reach million million tonne second half restart second mill explore debottlenecking mill could several hundred thousand tonne second half next year total initiative could roughly million tonne potash production project expect million north phosphate expect production roughly million tonne higher production total million tonne headwind experience last year address asset normal rate push improve recovery phosphate mine explore expansion quarry mine increase production extend life total consider footprint north production allocation aden finish product potential operate rate close million tonne total finish product production total million tonne take mission help world grow food need seriously believe geopolitical issue impact global supply first quarter reverse anytime soon result pull every lever efficiently raise production rate help offset supply shortage source also create value shareholder move portion call vice president investor relation financial plan analysis thank open line live address common question receive last night material release first question issue potash market geopolitical issue impact supply assume global supply replacement tonne might come thank together represent close global potash market absence nearly impossible replace today price reflect remain sanction previous assumption tonne come back midyear appear optimistic export curtail logistics another factor follow invasion tonne make market system make shipment transaction difficult expect buyer especially south work around hurdle overcome remain producer struggle make tonne near term push ahead debottlenecking plan expect others expect tight potash market extend beyond vice president investor relation financial plan analysis follow question issue much raise volume help fill specifically incremental million tonne thank actively increase productive capacity potash business already asset million tonne rate ramp million tonne annum move forward project actively work additional debottlenecking mill restart second mill vice president investor relation financial plan analysis potash price guidance second quarter elaborate reflect figure price guidance tonne increase include conservatism first today market price realization time depend railway ability return normal rate believe sooner rail return normal sooner price realization reflect shorter market price vice president investor relation financial plan analysis shift focus nutrient affordability grower begin hesitate give level fertilizer price thank anything inhibit grower demand availability nutrient affordability near term corn bushel near term soybean plus bushel palm tonne global grower solid profitability level north buyer behavior focus near term application weather force compress plant season today crop price suggest grower continue seek maximum yield grower appetite fertilizer quite strong especially recent crop price move slightly weaken real good monsoon predict government raise importer subsidy last week threat consumption
