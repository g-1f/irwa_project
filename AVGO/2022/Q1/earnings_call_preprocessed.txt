right thank thank everyone join today fiscal consolidate revenue record billion year year semiconductor solution revenue grow year year billion infrastructure software revenue grow year year billion enterprise demand grow robustly trough last year recovery enterprise spend continue accelerate meanwhile hyper cloud upgrade data center service provider telco continue deploy next generation fiber home expect year wireless grow single digit core software business remain stable steady supply front lead time remain extend unchanged inventory product channel customer remain lean semiconductor backlog close continue grow double digit prior quarter provide color market start network network revenue billion year year represent semiconductor revenue strong growth drive deployment scale compute offload across several hyperscale customer hence upgrade scale data center enterprise campus switch upgrade continue accelerate talk space investment backhaul telco operator worldwide continue drive strong growth family product opportunity silicon expand hyperscale significant move ethernet back network large scale cluster particular refer platform scale ethernet connect many thousand hyperscale platform build router device provide effective fabric congestion manage network highest efficiency load balance across link contrast proprietary protocol typically high performance compute latency ethernet forward large scale network widely adopt open architecture unique ability network complex workload hyperscale extend customize train inference footprint several cloud expect network continue strong across board revenue growth excess year year next server storage connectivity revenue million growth accelerate year year represent semiconductor revenue drive large part continue recovery enterprise spend much deploy toward upgrade compute server compute server either server storage connectivity also benefit increase content enterprise upgrade next generation storage connectivity solution support deployment lead edge server beyond enterprise proliferation video content social medium cloud customer increasingly adopt nearline hard disk drive primary storage choice manage large array hard disk drive deploy storage service utilize much next generation storage connectivity silicon software create another driver revenue growth interestingly also critical supplier nearline hard disk drive revenue grow last five year nearline revenue represent third hard drive business quarter adoption next generation technology sell board silicon result much higher dollar content dynamic couple continue strong demand enterprise hyperscale expect accelerate server storage connectivity revenue year year move broadband revenue million grow year year represent semiconductor revenue drive largely increase deployment next generation cable modem high attach rate home gateway example abound last quarter charter announce trial speed gigabit downstream gigabit upstream remote node start deployment gateway announce multi service gateway broadcom remain market leader deliver chip lead phone router enterprise access point carrier gateway first quarter cumulatively ship billion radio around three year since launch customer carrier partner ramp current generation make gigahertz band increasingly make available access across globe look ahead industry leader heavily invest strategic complement cable modem broadband next step broadband development deployment globally alone pending infrastructure access site billion next five year connect home high speed broadband across world happen next generation wide broadband better alternative home connectivity concern expect broadband business continue grow year year move wireless revenue billion represent semiconductor revenue demand north customer product continue strong quarter drive wireless revenue sequentially year year quarter fiscal expect wireless revenue seasonally teen quarter quarter still single digit year finally industrial revenue million represent approximately semiconductor revenue resale million grow year year drive robust demand electric vehicle renewable energy factory automation healthcare
