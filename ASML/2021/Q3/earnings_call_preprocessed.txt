billion billion item note expect delay revenue process increase capacity experience issue regard material shortage supply chain addition experience issue start logistics center issue largely address year output result late start assembly number system high demand environment customer request shipment factory acceptance test order bring system production quickly possible impact third quarter relatively small late start combine shipment expect impact revenue recognize fourth quarter include guidance still track achieve revenue growth approach full year expect base management sale around billion gross margin expect expect gross margin around full year expect expense around million expect come around million estimate annualized effective rate expect around interim dividend ordinary share dividend date date conversion record date dividend make payable purchase million share total amount around billion current previous program like turn call back president chief executive highlight record quarter sale profitability continue strong demand customer across market segment advance mature node drive demand across entire product portfolio total backlog billion include billion reflection healthy market environment today fully cover plan output begin bite early provide specific guidance expect market trend highlight throughout continue next year market trend drive strong demand across market segment across entire technology portfolio therefore continue increase capacity product meet customer capacity technology requirement logic strong market demand continue part ongoing digital transformation broaden application space distribute compute across landscape drive demand lead edge node also create significant demand mature node integral part grow digital infrastructure expect continue growth logic business customer demand remain strong advance mature node memory also expect continue growth business next year strong market demand server smartphones primary driver memory demand next year uncertainty demand picture tool utilization level remain high customer demand bite growth high teen percentage around meet demand expect bite growth customer need capacity continue make node migration customer migrate advance node also expect increase demand memory base business opportunity service growth next year continue expand base entire product portfolio increase contribution service technology ramp volume production drive expect continue shortage semiconductor component also opportunity grow upgrade revenue depend however customer willingness take system perform upgrade amid strong demand cycle meet strong demand across entire product portfolio first drive manufacture cycle time work supply chain increase output capability communicate investor expect increase unit output approximately time time primarily manufacture capacity addition supply chain time ship higher productivity machine take account higher unit output capacity plan expect increase effective wafer capacity approximately action supply chain increase output different time horizon materialize expect impact action start year extend next year still plan capacity around system next year system deliver higher productivity system mention last quarter utilize safety stock year significantly increase output buffer inventory next year therefore need rely build additional capacity mention actively work supply chain partner increase capacity next year final output depend supply chain progress although currently believe able reach shipment output summary
