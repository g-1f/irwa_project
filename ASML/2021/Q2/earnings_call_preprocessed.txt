introduction president chief executive skip welcome everyone thank join result conference call hope family healthy safe begin session would like provide overview commentary second quarter provide view come quarter start review financial performance comment short term outlook complete introduction additional comment current business environment future business outlook want executive vice president chief financial welcome everyone first review second quarter financial accomplishment provide guidance third quarter sale come within guidance billion guide lower revenue number system quarter receive factory acceptance test customer desire bring system production quickly possible therefore revenue recognize subsequent quarter completion acceptance test customer site ship system recognize billion revenue nine system quarter system ship quarter without factory acceptance test revenue recognize subsequent quarter customer site acceptance system ship without factory acceptance test able complete site acceptance test recognize revenue result nine revenue system system sale billion weight toward logic remain memory strength logic drive deep revenue memory business mainly drive base management sale quarter come billion guidance increase upgrade business customer continue pull forward software upgrade quickly increase productivity system high semiconductor demand environment gross margin quarter guidance primarily additional software upgrade business revenue account release operate expense expense come million expense million slightly lower guidance income billion represent sale result turn balance sheet second quarter cash cash equivalent short term investment level billion move order book system book come record billion include billion system strong order intake deep reflection global demand environment across market order intake largely drive logic book memory account remain majority order continue come logic customer also largest order intake quarter come multiple customer would like turn expectation third quarter expect total sale billion billion expect base management sale around billion gross margin expect expect expense around million expect come around million expense expect around sale expect remain around sale estimate annualized effective rate expect around final dividend ordinary share million together interim dividend result total dividend ordinary share increase compare dividend purchase million share program total amount around billion part financial policy return excess cash shareholder grow dividend share buyback announce share buyback program start execute part program intend repurchase share amount billion expect total million share cover employee share plan intend cancel remainder share repurchase program replace previous billion share buyback program repurchase approximately million share approximate amount billion complete full amount light share buyback program like turn call back president chief executive highlight good quarter sale profitability continue strong demand customer across market segment advance mature node drive demand across entire product portfolio compare last quarter expect annual sale growth rate toward expect revenue around year higher sale growth come ability increase output factory supply chain work meet strong customer demand look different market segment change last quarter expect stronger growth rate across market logic global demand continue strong across broad application space advance mature node compare last quarter expect logic revenue year year expect logic around year memory customer tight supply demand dynamic continue next year compare last quarter expect memory revenue year year expect memory revenue around year base business second quarter upgrade business stronger guide customer look upgrade provide fastest path increase wafer output capability compare last quarter expect base revenue year year expect base revenue around year continue strengthen outlook year majority increase come deep business increase plan factory output meet customer grow demand expect higher growth deep keep mind minimum stock level increase output partly usage service inventory supplier continue push manufacture capability able realize limit increase output expect revenue growth around year year increase communicate last quarter also ship first system deliver higher productivity capability system vast majority system second half system contribute increase wafer capacity customer fabs summarize year take account plan system output improvement second half expect sale growth gross margin full year look beyond read paper three trend highlight last quarter continue drive semiconductor equipment demand chip shortage partly decision make global pandemic first report automotive industry since move industry cause cyclical catch drive demand expect likely continue next year importantly secular growth digital transformation underway world become connect machine people people machine also machine machine expand application space secular driver high performance distribute compute fuel rapidly grow demand semiconductor demand lead edge device require power high performance application also require wide array application technology support build digital infrastructure compute also rapidly move edge sense technology require connect compute technology often mature nature lastly push technological sovereignty country region plan establish expand regional semiconductor manufacture capability attempt manage geographical semiconductor manufacture risk likely create level inefficiency semiconductor supply chain thus additional equipment demand although believe potential inefficiency manage large manufacturer crucial build additional infrastructure expect trend continue next several year fuel long term demand logic memory drive demand entire product portfolio future demand growth primarily drive logic increase layer count stronger wafer demand advance node also grow demand memory customer ramp volume production plan implement future node across three customer strong order intake quarter bring backlog total backlog billion include billion reflection healthy market environment today cover approximately plan output future deep demand drive grow wafer demand memory logic advance mature node increase time immersion require advance node memory logic technology require advance mature technology deep demand certainly product stronger longer order meet customer increase long term demand work hard supply chain increase capacity continue drive manufacture cycle time factory supply chain jointly supplier look across supply chain determine need people equipment build increase output capability deep activity different time horizon materialize deep response market demand need increase capacity beyond therefore start execute plan significantly increase capacity primarily system need since able next year surplus inventory deep module part fuel sale bite early provide specific detail capacity plan come year confirm target capacity increase supplier provide update soon finalize plan plan supply chain capacity around system look increase capacity system addition increase system capacity also drive product roadmap deliver higher productivity system increase effective wafer capacity plan shipment higher productivity system summary chip demand strong work maximize output meet customer demand secular growth trend part digital transformation connect world fuel future demand across market segment advance mature node increase confidence long term growth outlook plan provide update future scenario investor please book date would happy take question skip vice president investor right thank operator instruct momentarily protocol session beforehand would like kindly limit question short follow necessary allow many caller possible operator could final instruction first question please
