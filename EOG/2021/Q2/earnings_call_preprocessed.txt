shift double premium investment standard post outstanding result second quarter deliver adjust earn share nearly billion free cash flow repeat record level free cash flow generate last quarter outstanding operational performance include another beat high production guidance capital expenditure total unit operate expectation deliver exceptional productivity continue improve addition even though industry inflationary environment continue demonstrate company unique ability sustainably lower performance clearly power double reinvestment hurdle rate double premium require investment earn minimum direct rate return flat commodity price natural confident reinvestment hurdle stringent industry powerful catalyst drive future outperformance across financial metric include return capital employ free cash flow double premium improve potential generate free cash flow remain commit cash maximize shareholder value regular dividend debt reduction special dividend opportunistic buyback small high return bolt acquisition priority first half year reduce long term debt million demonstrate priority return cash significant cash shareholder commitment billion regular special dividend also close several high potential bolt acquisition basin last month year date commit billion debt reduction dividend slightly billion free cash flow generate look ahead second half year beyond free cash flow priority framework change generate additional free cash remain commit return cash shareholder meaningful focus right thing right time order maximize shareholder return last four year make huge progress reduce methane intensity rate nearly eliminate routine flare increase recycle water operation focus continue progress toward reduce emission line target ambition quarter announce carbon capture storage pilot project believe next step forward process reach zero ambition provide color emission reduction project moment drive innovative culture goal lowest highest return lowest emission producer play significant role long term future energy talk return continue improve president thank bill announce shift double premium investment standard start year shift underway since first establish premium investment standard minimum direct rate return conservative price deck natural life three year follow premium drill program drive increase earn share increase price environment nearly lower compare three year period prior premium comparative financial performance review slide investor presentation addition premium enable remarkable step change financial performance reinvesting discretionary cash flow average result billion cumulative free cash flow impact double investment hurdle rate conservative premium price deck position similar step change productivity boost return capital efficiency cash flow double premium offer shallower production decline significantly lower find development result payouts approximately month current strip price increase capital efficiency result reinvesting high return project increase potential generate significant free cash flow year average barrel equivalent find lower reserve continue drive basis company combine operate reduction drive higher full cycle return look back last four quarter earn return capital employ average earn double digit begin discipline reinvestment high return double premium drill premium location approximately double premium locate across core asset confident continue grow double premium inventory organic exploration improve productivity small bolt acquisition like premium last five year past month eight deal acre basin opportunistic bolt acquisition approximate acre opportunity within core asset position case receive immediate benefit exist infrastructure premium double premium establish higher threshold inventory exploration bolt acquisition focus improve quality inventory target return excess rate return hurdle record high quality inventory predominantly organic exploration need pursue expensive large deal turn outstanding year exceptional level return translate double digit corporate return employee continue position long term shareholder value creation update operational performance helm chief operate officer thank operate continue deliver strong result exceed production target produce slightly high guidance drive strong result addition capital come guidance result sustainable reduction already exceed target reduction first half expect average lower last year reminder addition save achieve continue operational improvement outpace inflationary pressure service sector average drill foot lateral complete single increase utilize recently discuss super zipper completion third package year expect percentage increase next year addition sand flat slightly year date line sight reduce sand source process expect start realize save second half water reuse another source significant save continue expand reuse infrastructure throughout development area finally renegotiate several expire higher price contract drill expect additional save remainder year next also strength balance sheet take advantage opportunity reduce future several area example last summer tubulars need drill program price lowest point immune inflationary pressure across industry forward look approach help mitigate anticipate increase reminder lock year remain actively work operational efficiency usual begin secure service product ahead next year activity goal keep least flat rest assure talented focus operational ultimate goal always push year amount freight place reduce unit operate result show reduce drive mainly lower workover expense reduce water handle expense lower maintenance expense save also realize technology develop internally optimize artificial lift several tool help reduce amount lift volume require produce without reduce overall production rate optimize tool reduce also help reduce amount compression horsepower need ultimately reduce greenhouse footprint continual improvement great testament please satisfy culture quarter also update final performance result last year reduce greenhouse intensity rate drive sustainable reduction flare intensity operational performance first half year indicate promise future improvement emission performance comfortably ahead pace meet intensity target methane goal eliminate routine flare achieve target first step path toward ambition zero emission water infrastructure investment also continue nearly water powder basin operation last year source reuse companywide operation water supply reuse source last year increase reduce freshwater fifth total water achievement along insight ongoing effort improve future performance detail sustainability report publish start fill piece road zero detail executive vice president exploration production thank earlier year announce zero ambition scope scope emission ambition aggressive achievable expect iterative process require trial error approach mirror develop asset pilot creative application exist technology determine effective solution optimize efficiency minimize maximize recovery natural maximize emission reduction apply successful technology solution across operation feasible zero strategy generally fall three category reduce capture offset focus directly reduce emission operation capture emission source concentrate storage offset remain emission reduce emission intensity operation direct immediate path reduce carbon footprint approach invest return mind seek achievable scalable result make excellent progress last four year initiative upgrade equipment field invest pilot exist technology leverage extensive data platform automate redesign process improve emission efficiency result since reduce intensity rate methane emission percentage flare intensity rate recently obtain permit expand successful pilot close loop capture project prevent flare event downstream interruption design automate system redirect natural back infrastructure system temporarily back exist project require modest investment capture resource would otherwise flare store future production beneficial result double premium return investment reduce flare emission wellhead capture rate roll additional close loop capture system help capture remain turn effort capture launch project capture carbon emission operation long term storage project design capture store concentrate source direct emission believe design solution generate return carbon capture storage leverage competitive advantage geology facility design field operation effort direct emission operation currently look expand effort another line business provide update pilot project progress also explore innovative solution emission reduction past month deploy capital several fuel substitution project power compressor natural pipeline operation natural artificial lift compressor largest source stationary combustion emission replace rich field lean residue reduce carbon intensity fuel lower emission improve engine efficiency lean residue also earn favorable financial return recover full value natural liquid versus component fuel another fuel substitution test conduct recently blend hydrogen natural still early stage analyze test data evaluate emission reduction would possible blend fuel operational economic scale excite part business like reduction improvement exploration success bottom drive initiative employee thrive type challenge create innovative solution apply technology solve problem improve process optimize efficiency generate industry lead return culture embrace zero ambition focus effort minimize carbon footprint quickly possible bill wrap bill chairman chief executive officer thank conclusion like note follow important takeaway first double reinvestment standard future potential earn cash flow performance best ever result first half year demonstrate power double premium begin another step change performance second
