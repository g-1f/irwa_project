chief scientific medical officer thank start today excite announcement positive line result tirzepatide phase study participant without type diabetes obesity overweight least comorbidity achieve weight loss week translate mean weight loss pound tirzepatide first investigational medicine deliver weight loss average phase study indeed people milligram tirzepatide trial achieve greater weight loss patient milligram achieve level weight reduction obesity chronic disease need effective treatment option patient work hard create potentially innovative medicine modernize disease approach hope tirzepatide first medicine program design test cover result detail first quickly provide overview phase program program people obesity overweight across study four global registration study slide trial design element four global registration study four study compare efficacy safety tirzepatide placebo adjunct reduce calorie diet increase physical activity design evaluate treatment tirzepatide compare placebo provide weight reduction safety data people without type diabetes obesity overweight least comorbidity provide weight reduction safety data people obesity overweight type diabetes provide data maximize weight loss follow intensive lifestyle program evaluate maintain weight loss expect remain three global study read middle note dose escalation program consistent surpass program treatment type diabetes tirzepatide patient start milligram tirzepatide move every four week milligram increment reach target dose study participant escalate maximum tolerate dose either milligram milligram patient escalate maximum tolerate dose provide opportunity evaluate full potential weight reduction study vary duration week continue week evaluate whether tirzepatide actually slow time
