milligram program aptly name tirzepatide surpass expectation initial readout display significantly greater hemoglobin reduction weight loss percent patient reach normal glucose level market slide impressive performance efficacy estimate analysis glycemic control tirzepatide dose demonstrate superiority trial across range patient population comparators background medication clear highlight impressive reduction milligram dose across different patient population higher provide additional glucose control surpass reduction move slide tirzepatide perform across three term patient achieve normal glycemic level people without type diabetes believe excite find reset expectation impact diabetes medication could patient efficacy estimate analysis across surpass half patient milligram dose tirzepatide achieve remarkable level control surpass focus patient background insulin glargine patient milligram tirzepatide achieve level compare patient placebo group remember patient population background basal insulin average duration diabetes year achieve level glucose control population something prior agonist like tirzepatide even contemplate possible slide show efficacy estimate analysis weight reduction across four study level efficacy previously think incretin therapy type diabetes patient others discuss study like award sustain begin show limit fully mechanism accomplish weight loss appear diminish return alone fully receptor mechanism flatten dose response curve occur look slide include importantly surpass quite clearly something different dual receptor agonist beyond flatten dose response curve performance believe evidence power mechanism highlight study include milligram dose deliver weight reduction surpass note weight gain insulin degludec comparator milligram dose nearly double weight reduction semaglutide milligram surpass strong performance milligram statistically superior weight loss even high milligram dose versus placebo active comparators encourage week study weight loss curve plateau higher really excite think tirzepatide could potentially perform longer duration treatment future study confidence efficacy data come phase know safety tolerability recall example primary phase trial patient therapy patient therapy week look slide please four surpass readout overall safety profile similar establish receptor agonist class commonly report adverse event relate mild moderate severity particularly encourage potential impact optimize dose escalation scheme accordingly tolerability profile observe phase program improve greatly comparison phase include lower rate diarrhea consistent phase study tolerate highly incretin therapy include addition please discontinuation rate adverse event range across study step back data bite excite safety efficacy result across perhaps especially efficacy milligram dose perform study include show superiority semaglutide milligram surpass reduction weight loss think data show milligram dose could great first incretin potentially deliver best class efficacy tolerability good better lead incretins maintenance dose milligram approve could potentially appropriate many patient physician know could higher available continue management disease tirzepatide could provide patient opportunity treatment goal might surpass previously think possible type diabetes term patient normal glucose control never contemplate potential treatment goal impressive weight loss highest dose tirzepatide roughly double weight loss semaglutide milligram surpass today type diabetes largely treat fail disease result tirzepatide approve could potentially provide doctor option enable early control glucose weight potential translate improve level organ protection meaningful reduction disease complication test potential tirzepatide ongoing plan study diabetes obesity heart failure accordingly initiate tirzepatide obesity line result expect next year move back diabetes line readout surpass

quarter previously comment space high progress molecule development raise recently tirzepatide still early advance phase base belief could exceed benefit tirzepatide molecule expect even weight loss achieve tirzepatide preserve glucose lower efficacy addition glucagon direct action liver also hope benefit consequently ambitious phase program design evaluate obesity type diabetes addition next generation incretins also excite novel weekly insulin basal insulin thank work weekly incretin therapy standard care space together tirzepatide hope incretin base therapy become standard care first

study invasive disease free survival interim analysis anticipate hazard ratio continue strengthen time event accrue important secondary endpoint study include distant relapse free survival overall survival submission note agree data immature thus unreliable share publication last year therefore update analysis review cycle determine trend favor give robust distant relapse free survival data highly confident overall survival data eventually reflect reinforce survival benefit take time event accrue especially adjuvant immunology positive phase readout baricitinib alopecia areata disease significant unmet medical need look forward regulatory submission start second half year also announce extend review period baricitinib atopic dermatitis three month another disease think inhibition could potentially alleviate important unmet medical need mirikizumab report positive phase result ulcerative colitis week induction study primary endpoint secondary endpoint look forward maintenance data early next year also update mirikizumab psoriasis program oasis program generate positive result safety efficacy similar believe psoriasis market serve highly effective treatment option include immunology strategy focus molecule indication area patient significant unmet need merely option leverage commercial presence create space effective solution like already exist patient therefore pursue submission mirikizumab psoriasis instead focus effort ulcerative colitis disease indication unmet medical need higher believe potential mechanism create standard care greater addition late stage
