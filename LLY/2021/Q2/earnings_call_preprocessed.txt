medical clearly productive year continue strong progress pipeline potential catalyst broader portfolio update spend minute highlight several update late stage pipeline start donanemab first amyloid long agent treatment disease approve accelerate approval pathway base plaque lower believe reflect shift policy path drug approval long advocate biomarkers amyloid plaque neurofibrillary identify patient treatment monitor response therapy please conclusion improvement brain pathology appropriate clinical efficacy drug base data date believe donanemab clear plaque faster deeper previously therapy achieve complete plaque clearance majority patient limit duration dose basis clinical evidence donanemab please receive breakthrough therapy designation association international conference last week share additional important analysis donanemab briefly highlight several find first share detail exploratory statistical analysis compare variety method beyond summarize slide please analysis show consistency effect primary secondary outcome across statistical method notably analysis conduct show good separation treatment placebo statistical significance achieve endpoint nearly relevant time point measure robustness treatment efficacy across analytical method increase confidence potential clinical benefit donanemab statistical method evaluate show similar result note disease progression model closely reflect observe data smallest standard error method result reinforce hypothesis prefer analytical method trial additionally share data show relationship amyloid plaque reduction slow cognitive decline show slide knowledge first time result available initially report result comment group level patient treat donanemab show statistically better plaque reduction statistically better slow cognitive decline month patient level correlation degree plaque reduction magnitude slow cognitive decline significant exploratory analysis available time course data show highly significant relationship degree amyloid plaque reduction slow cognitive decline model show publish result effort coalition major disease collect placebo data trial include almost participant introduce treatment incorporate percent amyloid plaque removal model generate result believe important support amyloid plaque reduction clinical efficacy notably data suggest full clearance amyloid plaque require highest efficacy model result predict patient achieve clearance amyloid plaque could slow disease progression move slide show exploratory analysis look effect donanemab plaque clearance development pathology pathology excite biomarker since measure disease unlike measure amyloid plaque correlate clinical measure cognitive functional decline note importantly previously show donanemab treat patient slower accumulation regional brain pathology placebo treat patient important find amount brain pathology excellent predictor subsequent cognitive decline find observe solanezumab expedition extend result show donanemab treat patient achieve complete clearance amyloid plaque month mark slow spread nearly complete progression frontal reinforce hypothesis deep rapid amyloid plaque clearance require optimal drug efficacy data present last week link degree amyloid plaque reduction degree clinical benefit degree amyloid plaque reduction degree benefit brain pathology link clinical benefit display slide recently obtain data plasma biomarker phospho data demonstrate amyloid plaque clearance donanemab also result reversal typical increase phosphorylated blood decrease baseline change untreated value highly significant effect early three month follow initiation treatment could reflect combination spread brain neuronal damage could account leakage periphery right side slide effect plasma also correlate degree plaque reduction nearly every patient treatment achieve substantial plaque clearance show flat decline plasma phospho delight potential utility diagnose disease also monitor treatment efficacy believe could another important contribution field finally slide significant relationship plasma reduction slow cognitive decline show additional biomarker efficacy link donanemab mechanism amyloid plaque clearance positive effect clinical outcome pathology data suggest patient achieve decrease baseline show slow disease progression three main find discuss consistency clinical benefit across statistical method correlation plaque lower clinical benefit patient achieve greatest plaque clearance greatest opportunity benefit three correlation achieve complete plaque clearance beneficial effect pathology brain measure periphery predictor clinical benefit strongly support efficacy donanemab give confidence remarkable level amyloid plaque clearance achieve donanemab could translate meaningful breakthrough patient move slide accordingly announce plan submit accelerate approval pathway year base data complete study supplement additional safety data ongoing study remain focus replicate positive result replication important overcome skepticism field hope generate important confirmatory data patient physician payer help understand make sure right patient right duration therapy right stage disease please announce today close screen adequate number subject trial screen process fully enroll study give conduct process image study screen take several week complete expect final subject complete screen procedure receive first dose donanemab placebo third quarter study complete month later give progress enrollment confident achieve number duration drug exposure need appropriately characterize safety profile donanemab allow regulatory submission year discussion consistent prior statement support submission also want provide comment believe national coverage determination open monoclonal antibody therapy target amyloid center service impact donanemab believe clear opportunity focus treatment patient likely benefit amyloid plaque reduce therapy would align goal long advance diagnostic tool identify right patient benefit amyloid reduce therapy particularly encourage progress plasma assay could open broader access diagnostic tool still despite advance diagnostics promise donanemab acknowledge current skepticism national discussion hope drug evaluate payer prescribers base data could particularly important give data share today suggest degree donanemab amyloid plaque clearance relate clinical benefit summary look forward submit donanemab later year potential bring robust amyloid plaque clear agent limit treatment duration market early symptomatic patient potential replicate clinical efficacy result expect transition last earn call comment overall survival trend favor trial adjuvant breast cancer also note data quite immature overall population make interpretation challenge provide additional data study encourage continue strengthen primary endpoint invasive disease free survival consistent benefit secondary endpoint distant recurrence free survival note continue follow confirm benefit extend beyond year treatment period look forward disclose analysis medical meet fall discussion focus specify patient high index marker increase cell proliferation patient aggressive disease higher risk relapse thus mature overall survival analysis group make approximately half population demonstrate overall survival trend favor treatment base feedback expect initial approval adjuvant breast cancer population year line current review cycle importantly since hazard ratio favor similar patient high index expect trend first high population time replicate broader study population hope expand label entire population future overall survival event broader population date regulator outside raise question overall survival finally move share meet action date supplemental drug application atopic dermatitis delay relate ongoing assessment inhibitor patient safety critical continue evaluate baricitinib safety provide ongoing observational safety study confident efficacy safety data baricitinib support favorable benefit risk profile treatment atopic dermatitis look forward continue work remainder review process additional information time specific action date potential regulatory action atopic dermatitis later year commit bring market help meet need people live atopic determine slide show
