quarter result believe total growth quarter understate strength experience traditional manufacture construction customer chart page illustrate product side also demonstrate growth fastener sale product segment exclude janitorial also safety sale safety product remove period direct ship typically relate bulk product national account sale smaller account adjust government remain customer would bottom line continue experience broad strength traditional market consistent macro data point industrial production price contribute basis point growth third quarter basis point second quarter reflect action take year date mitigate increase product particularly steel transportation particularly overseas ship inflation continue rise course third quarter particularly overseas container ship service range effort underway mitigate impact inflation customer price action also necessary fourth quarter aside inflation discuss marketplace continue experience tight supply chain labor shortage disruption impact customer production third quarter previous quarter increase infection challenge trend seem likely persist near term address continue lean technology branch initiative improve productivity organizational culture empower local leader sustain high service level supply chain remain elongate expect inflow import product fourth quarter first quarter sustain high product availability reduce impact fill slide operate margin third quarter flat versus third quarter sorry third quarter gross margin third quarter basis point versus third quarter relate item first experience good leverage overhead organizational expense strong product demand growth second better product margin primarily safety product lower margin affect smaller proportion total safety sale versus last year margin affect product increase product customer impact gross margin third quarter versus prior year contrast favorable impact experience second quarter relatively strong fastener growth allow positive product offset negative impact strong onsite growth customer narrower sequentially trend likely persist impact price third quarter exceed original expectation inflation ship similarly exceed expectation result price continue largely neutral gross margin third quarter increase gross margin offset operate expense grow faster sale part comparison third quarter operate expense leverage still reflect relate labor intensity sale versus current sale generate traditional high touch manner relevant however role reset first year manufacture recovery typical various operate expense outsized recovery experience include third quarter also believe breadth reset unusually wide instance increase incentive also increase fuel increase travel expense increase healthcare nature past downturn recovery would necessarily lead dramatic arise particularly latter item last quarter deleveraging operate expense third quarter function anniversarying first period pandemic relate save measure combine strongly recover marketplace similar dynamic likely play fourth quarter although likely order magnitude anticipate able leverage comparable level growth together report third quarter third

difficulty limit purchase vehicle brand supply product liquidity standpoint finish third quarter debt total capital debt total capital debt year period versus fourth quarter essentially revolver remain available formal presentation operator take question question answer operator operator instruction first question come research please ahead research analyst good morning everybody president chief executive officer good morning executive vice president chief financial officer good morning fact positively surprise growth rate particularly close quarter seem least maybe product availability issue maybe maybe read wrong particular area really struggle procure product think supply chain stuff stick coast maybe commentary provide president chief executive officer look variety supply chain partner domestic supply chain partner might sell many case brand product might domestically manufacture north manufacture globally manufacture item item commodity makeup fastener high player tend produce offshore case year appreciate safety stock depth inventory domestically source product think supply chain think distribution center service level measure fulfillment branch network good spot product bring overseas manufacture overseas thing help process grief year analyst community justifiably carry inventory inventory spread across location branch distribution center give resiliency peer right product come port immune maybe little resourcefulness locally business model sole leverage scale thing tough kind fall apart model leverage scale thing tough local step fill brutally hard work today point probably anecdotal feedback regional vice president month quarter point ability identify locate product locally able import fastener portion certainly challenge locate domestic product anecdotal feedback field better able sustain service level absolutely right difficulty import product traditional supply chain find answer outside traditional supply chain allow retain high service level customer research analyst okay helpful quick follow imagine smaller competitor probably struggle right maybe able maintain service level clean balance sheet maybe comment pipeline opportunity maybe pickup smaller competitor struggle president chief executive officer think couple front perception would struggle marketplace deep robust supply chain many different place alternative even truck network able move stuff around competitor product incredibly expensive move expensive expensive efficient think biggest risk smaller deep supply chain actually head perception fill activity stuff import others fill product become scarce marketplace believe even better position serve customer herculean effort make happen look opportunity pipeline evaluate strategic opportunity rather simply pick perhaps struggle competitor mean consolidation primary focus look acquisition primary strategic point think better balance sheet invest work capital need sustain type service level turn pressure smaller customer allow gain market share without premium research analyst thank president chief executive officer thank operator thank next question come please ahead analyst thank good morning president chief executive officer good morning executive vice president chief financial officer good morning analyst first question operate expense look sequentially year either number sell sometimes minus third quarter fourth quarter year math right lose sell offset know reset inflation thing give situation think give relative roughly million report third quarter think fourth quarter executive vice president chief financial officer right count sequential basis would lose couple sell leverage give seasonality right fourth quarter typically quite active period occur third quarter happen every year think look history history would suggest would expect flat give take really depend heavily compensation right whether flat really drive compensation make sense operate expense line note think whereas difficult comparison standpoint little bite easy comparison wage standpoint wage defer last year necessarily replicate year create little bite easier comparison think somewhat lower growth lower gross margin bank honestly think somewhere within normal range still make sense analyst okay helpful thank quickly slide expect effectively leverage similar growth similar growth part statement kind outlook placeholder leverage comment executive vice president chief financial officer sort outlook simply guess better would thing equal prediction know crystal ball consist primarily extend much past begin know prediction analyst thank appreciate operator thank next question come loop capital please ahead loop capital analyst morning everyone thank take question guess first maybe update third quarter kind customer comment retention past update kind retention look like kind today executive vice president chief financial officer quarter still definition retention customer previously purchase prior last year pandemic begin settle first time right understand definition still recognize little million revenue customer third quarter little bite period still represent significant investment opportunity within healthcare space derive environment experience last month loop capital analyst okay helpful guess miss prepare material dynamic price environment obviously comment kind expect line impact fourth quarter mean subject change sort kind snapshot today would great president chief executive officer always feel need also plan dynamic environment would exit rate perhaps little stronger entrance rate believe probably continue edge range experience surprise number little higher also keep pretty good expect container thing like begin flow model think edge could incremental price mean
