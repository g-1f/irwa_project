without weather benefit benefit detail later adjust reflect strength base business position asset reliable operation come deliver another quarter growth almost operate metric despite severe weather fact average daily firm contract transmission capacity average daily transport volume average daily gather volume average daily plant volume increase quarter quarter basis extreme weather experience first quarter really underscore importance resilient reliable energy network also stand front firm service transmission system fact northwest pipeline another record throughput storm demonstrate affordable dependable natural critical part energy work support grow economy meet challenge face around climate change abroad truly believe exist infrastructure tomorrow clean energy economy talk plan future focus area meantime financial result senior vice president chief financial high level summary quarter benefit impact winter storm clear collect receivable receivables relative event even beyond winter storm impact nice increase profitability northeast gather system uplift revenue pipeline project service last year higher profit market activity west segment profit offset somewhat higher bonus expense accrual reflect solid year unfold lower revenue downtime issue first quarter year strong performance statistic page fact improvement financial metric first adjust quarter million even exclude impact winter storm adjust variance depth moment adjust quarter increase simply reflect impact higher grow quarter similarly growth essentially cash operation include cash flow exclude work capital fluctuation capital investment quarter million consider roughly million maintenance capital dividend million generate million excess cash quarter also dividend coverage page base divide dividend strong time strong cash generation strong quarter along continue capital discipline help move toward leverage metric goal time later guidance update deck move guidance year around time year around time year really proud success front next slide little deeper result quarter perform quarter dive segment believe important isolate item part core business first item impact winter storm operation west impact produce million benefit include positive impact market operation offset somewhat reduce revenue process facility whose rate impact liquid margin also slightly lower volume continent collectively estimate winter storm impact west volume quarter addition also realize million uplift profit upstream asset acquire million normal operation upstream asset total winter storm impact million benefit benefit even without impact winter storm core operation transmission asset produce result million period last year however transmission pipeline project million incremental revenue quarter include phase project come service second quarter last year southeastern trail project service fourth quarter last year portion south project service fourth quarter last year evidence growth firm reserve capacity first quarter revenue increase almost entirely offset lower revenue production downtime issue lower revenue lower rate market effect upon close rate case last year bill year last year give last year leap year believe million impact transmission revenue reduce result segment really nothing revenue largely higher operate expense interestingly enough impact higher bonus accrual equity compensation accrual give strong start year traditionally increase accrual later year addition slightly higher compression expense segment move northeast segment continue come strong contribute million additional quarter collectively total northeast gather volume grow quarter versus first quarter last year process volume grow volume growth predominantly supply benefit gather system expansion
