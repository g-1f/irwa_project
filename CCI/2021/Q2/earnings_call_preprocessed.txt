target establish expand fiber small cell strategy completion largest acquisition growth target increase basis point prior target since expect diverse portfolio increase ability consistently drive long term growth since time strategy work better expect grow dividend share compound annual growth rate year drive outsized growth fiber small cell business like last year year like drive higher growth tower business record level activity exist wireless carrier increase spend equipment tower site start build nationwide network scratch expect elevate level activity continue beyond year support future growth tower drive strong growth tower business year initial focus customer tower also lead delay small cell deployment shift time expect complete nearly small cell contractually commit backlog combine zone permit challenge previously disclose sprint cancellation expect deploy approximately small cell year next year remain nearly current backlog complete beyond delay impact view long term attractiveness small cell since fundamental need small cell continue unit economics remain line expectation small cell already important small cell tool carrier network capacity reuse spectrum shorter shorter distance believe small cell even important tool forward nature wireless network require continue cell site densification meet increase demand data especially network deploy result believe time factor alter long term return investment ability deliver growth objective second quarter result expectation balance bite detail want focus comment morning strategy deliver highest risk adjust return shareholder core principle strategy focus market believe best market communication infrastructure ownership attractive growth profile lowest risk view mind invest nearly billion share infrastructure

investment begin year approximately yield build acquire asset could share across multiple customer provide lower customer lease asset year generate return shareholder prove value proposition customer time tower asset generate yield invest capital meaningful capacity support additional growth realize wireless network architecture would need evolve require network cell site would much denser closer user expand share infrastructure offer beyond tower establish industry lead small cell business encourage business already generate current yield invest capital give relative investment provide additional visibility investment progress update analysis cohort five market introduce year look collective view five market perform last year slide five growth small cell fiber solution contribute incremental yield approximately million incremental capital investment adjust time impact associate large process small cell project capital investment occur advance correspond revenue cash flow incremental yield approximately incremental yield result modest decline combine cash yield year currently line expectation invest small cell initial yield expect grow time lease asset additional customer last year market route mile high capacity fiber support deployment approximately small cell importantly approximately small cell deploy locate exist fiber balance represent anchor build attractive area market expect capture future small cell fiber solution demand believe market show slide provide helpful representation overall strategy perform time give different market come average life investment density small cell node mile fiber degree contribution small cell fiber solution generally speak would expect market longer average investment life higher return mature asset true time customer exist asset consistent historical experience tower average tenant tenant every year similar experience movement yield tower investment time show back page four sometimes steady climb yield legacy investment obvious invest mature asset bring overall market yield certainly true cohort much relate average life investment density small cell route mile fiber since tower business location additional node exist fiber drive yield time consequently typically higher percentage node locate exist fiber density node increase third characteristic believe market small cell fiber solution ultimately higher yield revenue stream setup backdrop want share observation think important highlight data page look across market longer average investment life tend correspond higher yield least mature capital base lowest market yield mature capital base highest yield addition higher density node mile generally correlate longer investment life higher percentage locate node generate higher market yield financial benefit associate locate node apparent look incremental yield last year half small cell deploy across market locate exist fiber result strong incremental yield meanwhile framework feature highest node density lowest yield part explanation market spend originally budget initial build activity weigh start yield importantly last month achieve strong yield incremental invest capital increase market yield basis point consistent experience broadly small cell business locate node exist fiber come high incremental yield drive attractive return time finally look financial benefit small cell fiber solution leverage asset base market meaningful contribution offer generally perform better best example point despite mature capital base lower node density generate similar yield invest capital nearly primarily higher contribution fiber solution experience also highlight another important point assess performance portfolio asset similar throughout long history tower zoom particular asset focus short time period picture always perfect last year market yield contract basis point combination lack small cell activity priority market customer mute growth fiber solution despite still generate attractive yield invest capital believe dense fiber footprint market position capture future small cell fiber solution growth summary combine performance cohort market provide another point validation strategy small cell fiber solution growth contribute attractive incremental yield continue make discretionary investment asset expand long term growth opportunity turn back overall strategy obvious last month connectivity vital economy live interact another strategy provide profitable solution connect community people business also inherently sustainable share
