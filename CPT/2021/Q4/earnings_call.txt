The opening ceremony for the 2022 Winter Olympics are today. And as you could tell from our on-hold music and slide show, team Camden has embraced the Olympic Spirit. The Olympic theme set me down memory lane and into Camden's archive for the video I'm going to show you today. During the 2012 Summer Olympics, the U.S. women's swim team made a video using a very popular song titled Call Me Maybe. At Camden, we are proud to be a friendly and welcoming workplace. One unique way we showed this is by greeting teammates with a hug instead of a handshake. Camden employees probably give and receive more hugs per day than any other workplace in America. So if you combine our hugging culture with the Olympic spirit, a Call Me Maybe video becomes a Hug Me Maybe video. And following the 2012 Olympics this happened at our corporate office.[Commercial break] One of the many adjustments in Camden's world caused by social distancing during the pandemic was replacing actual hugs with virtual hubs. Since Camden is a fully vaccinated workplace, we have recently seen an uptick in breakthrough cases of actual hugging in our workplace. We all look forward to the day when all virtual hubs at Camden will become actual hubs. 2021 turned out to be a remarkable year, and we clearly exceeded our original guidance that we provided at this time last year. Our 2021 budget call for FFO of $5 per share, with same property revenues up slightly and net operating income down approximately 1%. As reported last night, we closed 2021 with FFO of $5.39 per share and same-property growth of 4.3% and 4.8% for revenues and net operating income, respectively. We expect 2022 to be our best year on record for earnings and same-property growth. The midpoint of our 2022 guidance calls for FFO per share of $6.24, with same-property revenue growth of 8.75% and net operating income growth of 12%. Our geographically and product diverse portfolio in the Sunbelt markets continue to outperform. I want to thank each of our Camden team members for their hard work and commitment to our values and for improving the lives of our team members and our customers one experience at a time. 2021 was a great year, but the best is yet to come. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Keith Oden.Keith Oden -- Executive Vice Chairman and President Thanks, Ric. We have a tradition of assigning letter grades to forecast conditions in our markets at the beginning of every year. I'll start with a review of the supply and demand conditions we expect to encounter in Camden's markets during 2022 and ranked the markets in the order of best to worst. For the first time in 10 years, Camden's overall portfolio earned an A with a stable outlook and no market received a grade below A. In addition, we are now providing this report card to you as part of our earnings call slide deck which is showing now and will be posted on our website after today's call. We anticipate overall same-property revenue growth this year in the range of 7.75% to 9.5% for our entire portfolio, with most of our markets falling within that range. The outliers on the positive side would be Phoenix and our Florida markets, which should produce double-digit revenue growth than Houston and D.C., which will likely lag the overall portfolio average but still show significant improvement versus 2021. Our outlook for supply and demand in 2022 is based on multiple third-party economic forecasts that generally reflects strong job growth in Camden's markets, coupled with a steady amount of new supply. Estimates range from 1 million to 1.2 million new jobs created in our 15 major markets in 2022, along with 150,000 to 200,000 new completions. So our outlook reflects somewhere around the midpoint of both projections. It is likely no surprise that for 2022, our top ranking once again goes to Phoenix, which has averaged 7% revenue growth over the past three years and has an expected revenue growth well above 10% this year. We give this market an A+ rating with a stable outlook. Supply and demand metrics for 2022 look well balanced with estimates calling for 80,000 new jobs in Phoenix and 18,000 new units coming online this year. Up next are our three Florida markets: Southeast Florida, Tampa, and Orlando. Each also earned A+ ratings with stable outlooks. These three markets should achieve revenue growth of over 10% in 2022 and are projected to have strong job growth to offset new supply coming online. Current estimates for job growth were approximately 50,000 in both Southeast Florida and Tampa and 60,000 in Orlando. Completions are expected to be 10,000, 6,000 and 9,000 units, respectively. Our next 8 markets all earned an A rating with a stable outlook and should produce revenue growth generally within our guidance range of 3.75 to 9.75 in 2022. Atlanta, Austin, and Raleigh should achieve revenue growth toward the high end of our guidance range in 2022. In Atlanta, job growth is expected to be 90,000 with around 10,000 new apartment completions. In Austin, projections call for 50,000 additional jobs with completions of roughly 18,000 units. And in Raleigh, the jobs to completions ratio should be five times with 35,000 new jobs versus 7,000 new apartment completions San Diego, Inland Empire, and Charlotte are next falling around the middle of the pack in Camden's portfolio. For the San Diego Inland Empire market, we expect to see over 100,000 new jobs in 2022 and with new supply around 8,000 units. Charlotte should also deliver 8,000 units with 40,000 new jobs created, providing a good balance of supply and demand in that market. Nashville is Camden's newest market as we acquired two communities there last summer. While Nashville will not be included in our 2022 same-property pool, we would rate the city as an A with a stable outlook. There has been a significant amount of construction in Nashville, and that will continue in 2022, with approximately 10,000 new units expected to deliver this year. However, demand for apartment homes has remained strong in Nashville with positive end migration trends and projections for over 40,000 new jobs. Dallas and Denver are both solid markets, and we expect market conditions to be favorable again in 2022. Supply demand ratios in Dallas and Denver remained steady with 95,000 and 55,000 new jobs anticipated, respectively, during 2022, with supply at 15,000 and 10,000 new units, respectively, scheduled for delivery this year. L.A., Orange County in Houston are the last two markets earning an A rating, but both have improving outlooks. Our portfolio in LA County saw higher delinquencies and bad debt in 2021 than our other markets, but we are hopeful that conditions will improve in 2022 as COVID restrictions begin to ease and regulatory issues around evictions are reduced. L.A., Orange County faces healthy operating conditions with favorable supply and demand metrics. Job growth should be around 150,000 with completions of 16,000 expected in 2022. In Houston, conditions began to improve in 2021, and after the market has struggled with many new lease-ups giving high levels of concessions. New supply is expected to ease in 2022 to around 17,000 units and job growth should remain strong with around 75,000 new jobs expected. Our final market is D.C. Metro, which we gave an A-, but with an improving outlook. Supply remains steady with over 13,000 new units coming on this year, but job growth should be healthy as well with 80,000 new jobs expected. Similar to L.A., Orange County, Washington, D.C. has been a challenging market given the COVID environment and the many restrictions that were put in place as a result of the pandemic. While we are optimistic that 2022 will reflect an improved operating environment there, we have budgeted low to mid-single-digit revenue growth for D.C. Metro this year. Now a few details on our fourth quarter '21 operating results in January 2022 trends. Same-property revenue growth was 8.5% for the fourth quarter and 4.3% for full year 2021. Our top performers for the fourth quarter all had over 10% revenue growth and included Tampa, Phoenix, Southern California, Raleigh, and Southeast Florida. Rental rates for the fourth quarter had signed new leases up 16.7%, renewals up 14.1%, and a blended rate of 15.5%. Our preliminary January results indicate similar trends with blended growth of over 15% on signed leases. February and March renewal offers were sent out with an average increase in the mid-14% range. Occupancy averaged 97.1% during the fourth quarter and compared to 97.3% last quarter and 95.5% in the fourth quarter of '20. January 2022 occupancy has averaged 97.2% compared to 95.7% in January of last year and is slightly up from our fourth quarter '21 levels. Annual net turnover for 2021 was in line with 2020 at 41%. And move-outs to home purchases were 15.8% for the quarter and 16.4% for the full year of 2021, relatively in line with our reported 15.8% for full year 2020. I'll now turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's chief financial officer.Alex Jessett -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate activities. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we purchased Camden Greenville, a recently constructed 558 unit mid-rise community in Dallas. And we purchased five acres of land in Denver and two acres of land in Nashville for future development purposes. For the full year of 2021, we have completed acquisitions of four communities with 1,684 apartment homes for a total cost of approximately $633 million, ahead of our original 2021 acquisition guidance of $450 million. and we acquired four undeveloped land parcels for a total cost of approximately $72 million. Additionally, during the quarter, we disposed of two operating communities in Houston, and one operating community in Laurel, Maryland for total proceeds of approximately $260 million. These three dispositions were on average 21 years old, with average monthly rents of $1,350 per door and annual capex of approximately $2,300 per door. Using actual capex, these dispositions were completed at a 3.9% AFFO yield, generating a 10.5% unleveraged IRR over a 20-year hold period. Based on a broker cap rate, which assumes $350 per door in capex and a 3% management fee on trailing 12-month NOI, the cap rate would have been 4.3%. And finally, during the quarter, we stabilized ahead of schedule Camden North End two, a 343 unit, $79 million new development in Phoenix, generating an approximate 8.75% yield. And we completed construction on Camden Hillcrest, an $89 million new development in San Diego. On the financing side, during the quarter, we issued approximately $180 million of shares under our existing ATM program. Moving on to financial results. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the fourth quarter of 2021 of $160.2 million or $1.51 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our prior guidance range by $0.02 per share. This outperformance resulted primarily from higher levels of occupancy and rental rates at our non-same-store acquisition and development communities and lower taxes and utilities at our same-store communities. For 2021, we delivered full-year same-store revenue growth of 4.3%, expense growth of 3.5%, and NOI growth of 4.8% as compared to our original 2021 same-store guidance of 0.75% for revenue, 3.5% for expenses, and negative 0.85% for NOI. You can refer to Page 27 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our 2022 financial outlook. We expect our 2022 FFO per share to be in the range of $6.09 to $6.39 and with a midpoint of $6.24, representing an $0.85 per share increase from our 2021 results. This increase is anticipated to result primarily from an approximate $0.79 per share increase in FFO related to the performance of our same-store portfolio. At the midpoint, we are expecting same-store net operating income growth of 12%, driven by revenue growth of 8.75% and expense growth of 3%. Each 1% increase in same-store NOI is approximately $0.065 per share in FFO. An approximate $0.35 per share increase in FFO related to the growth in operating income from our non-same-store joint venture and retail communities, resulting primarily from higher rental rates, lower bad debt, and the incremental contribution of our four acquisitions completed in 2021 and our nine development communities in lease-up during either 2021 and/or 2022. And an approximate $0.07 per share increase in FFO due to an assumed $600 million of pro forma acquisitions spread throughout the year at an initial yield of 3.5%. This $1.21 cumulative increase in anticipated FFO per share is partially offset by an approximate $0.11 per share decrease in FFO from our completed 2021 dispositions, an approximate $0.04 per share decrease in FFO from an assumed $250 million of pro forma dispositions anticipated to primarily occur late 2022, an approximate $0.03 per share decrease in FFO, resulting primarily from the combination of lower interest income from lower cash balances higher franchise and margin taxes and higher corporate depreciation and amortization. Our combined general and administrative, property management, and fee and asset management expenses are anticipated to be effectively flat year over year and an approximate $0.18 per share decrease in FFO due to the additional shares outstanding for full year 2022, following our 2021 ATM activity. Our revenue growth midpoint of 8.75% is based upon an anticipated 11% average increase in new leases and a 7% average increase in renewals. We are also anticipating that occupancy will moderate slightly to 96.5%. Page 27 of our supplemental package also details other assumptions for 2022, including the plan for $400 million to $600 million of on-balance sheet development starts spread throughout the year with approximately $315 million of annual development spend. We expect FFO per share for the first quarter of 2022 to be within the range of $1.45 to $1.49. The midpoint of $1.47, represents a $0.04 per share decrease from the fourth quarter of 2021, which is primarily the result of an approximate $0.02 per share decrease in FFO, resulting from our fourth quarter 2021 dispositions; an approximate $0.01 per share decrease in sequential same-store net operating income, resulting primarily from the reset of our annual property tax accrual on January 1 of each year and other expense increases, primarily attributable to typical seasonal trends, including the timing of on-site salary increases. And an approximate $0.01 per share decrease in FFO due to the additional shares outstanding from our fourth quarter 2021 ATM activity. Our balance sheet remains strong, with net debt to EBITDA at 3.8 times and a total fixed charge coverage ratio at 6.4 times. As of today, we have approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity, comprised of approximately $500 million in cash and cash equivalents and no amounts outstanding under our $900 million unsecured credit facility. At quarter end, we had $199 million left to spend over the next two years under our existing development pipeline, and we have no scheduled debt maturities until late 2022. Our current excess cash is invested with various banks, earning approximately 15 basis points. At this time, we'll open the call up to questions.
