We're not going to be making any opening remarks today, but we will start with the same safe harbor.Statements that we make during this call that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and/or from our forecast. We assume no responsibility for updating forward-looking statements.For more information, please refer to the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in our SEC filings. Also as part of the process for FCC Auction 110, we filed an application to participate as a bidder for those spectrum licenses. Because of the FCC's anti-collusion rules, we're not able to discuss that option, and we will not be taking questions on that during today's call.

 



That's it. And with that, Alan, let's open it up to questions, and let's start with the analysts first.
