enterprise second quarter base business perform exceptionally strong growth also deliver million unite state government entire supply contract also continue advance multiple program across innovative pipeline several important readout start global sale billion grow compare prior year reflect recovery pandemic impact second quarter sale grow continue high term efficacy safety convenience also perform exceptionally quarter global sale billion growth quarter also mark first time exceed billion quarterly sale remain considerable room growth line indication potential opportunity chronic spontaneous urticaria last week announce positive phase study result additional phase readout prurigo nodularis eosinophilic esophagitis pediatric atopic dermatitis later year could advance conviction pipeline product address numerous inflammatory disease oncology global sale million grow meaningful growth contribution inside outside unite state also announce morning large phase pivotal study small cell lung cancer combine standard chemotherapy reduce risk death nearly compare chemotherapy alone eager share data regulatory agency approve would dramatically increase number lung cancer eligible patient could treat also begin meaningful result genetics medicine pipeline collaborator show first ever proof concept vivo genome edit investigational therapy transthyretin amyloidosis amyloidosis proof concept study utilize systemically administer technology genome modification suggest approach could broad applicability across wide range disease beyond collaboration help form whole pipeline next generation therapy beyond broad diverse antibody pipeline second quarter represent another landmark effort combat unfortunately despite considerable rate vaccination continue major global health concern rise case emerge variant addition entire supply contract unite state government able secure emergency authorization update lower gram subcutaneous dose post exposure prophylaxis certain appropriate patient high risk disease utilization increase rapidly currently order week also announce recovery study show reduction risk death patient mount immune response result together support data study patient momentarily potential authorize first treatment wide spectrum disease prevention summary core business strong continue diversify innovative pipeline continue advance position long term growth turn call scientific founder president chief scientific officer thank talk morning possible colleague work nonstop throughout pandemic unfortunately world still global pandemic number individual unite state climb nearly become every therefore start monoclonal antibody cocktail emergency authorization update include lower gram dose intravenous subcutaneous administration nonhospitalized patient support phase data show gram dose reduce risk hospitalization death last week expand include utilization post exposure prophylaxis certain population also allow repeat monthly dose high risk patient immunocompromised high risk ongoing exposure individual institutional latest authorization make treatment available treat individual also prevent infection certain would like emphasize substitute vaccination still review additional data believe could broaden prevention application exposure prophylaxis extend treatment paradigm patient detail part phase prophylaxis study assess efficacy safety subcutaneous prevent infection among previously individual publish today journal medicine believe enormous unmet need protect immunocompromised individual respond vaccine hope agree data support authorization exposure prophylaxis patient recently report test part university phase recovery study meet primary outcome reduce risk death patient lack immune response data smaller study patient show similar conclusion reduction overall mortality study limit earlier stage patient oxygen oxygen support collective data recovery study patient share regulator addition track complete submission second half outside unite state collaborator obtain emergency temporary pandemic authorization antibody cocktail know outside unite state country across union authorization expect soon
