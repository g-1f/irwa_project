quality crop grow region previously assume potato crop approach historical average outside potato expect double digit inflation production input edible transportation package continue fiscal previously assume would begin gradually ease second half year also expect macro challenge slow turnaround supply chain continue fiscal expect labor transportation action describe earlier along productivity initiative help continue gradually stabilize operation improve production rate throughput manage year progress full year expect gross margin least point point normalize annual margin rate recognize wide range reflect volatility high degree uncertainty regard pressure discuss consistent prior year better understand crop financial impact next couple month provide update release second quarter result early gross margin expect quarterly expense high continue investment improve operation long term equity earn likely remain pressure input inflation higher manufacture also update couple target year first reduce capital expenditure estimate million previous estimate million million significant reduction time spend behind large capital project effectively shift spend early fiscal despite shift expenditure expansion project remain track open spring fall respectively second reduce estimate full year effective rate approximately previous estimate estimate total interest expense around million total depreciation amortization expense approximately million remain unchanged summary strong recovery demand help fuel line growth first quarter higher manufacture distribution lead
