demand recover impact global pandemic vaccine rollouts ramp around world expect rise demand combine continue discipline publicly trade operator rebalance inventory supportive higher price solid free cash flow across industry follow resilient natural market longer term demand outlook appear increasingly positive anticipate future demand improve government around world accelerate transition toward cleaner source energy accordingly potential upside demand view previously call demand decade base recent third party analysis directionally support discussion customer potential global demand outside focus cleaner energy source technology decarbonize resource intense industry continue accelerate closely align develop nation steer government policy incentivize clean energy source carbon capture technology believe policy shift crucial support industrywide investment area like renewables green hydrogen overall macro view mind continue believe take right step strategic priority position leader energy transition busy start make solid progress three pillar strategy first pillar transform core business continue identify remove structural operation evidence improvement margin despite lower revenue goal continue optimize process infrastructure order deliver reduction footprint consolidation addition action continue focus portfolio optimization narrow focus streamline operation improve overall operate efficiency example first quarter announce agreement create joint venture company contribute subsea drill system product line business transaction help align portfolio long term strategic objective additionally complete sale pressure pump asset include hydraulic fracture fleet coil tube unit relate equipment second pillar invest growth continue identify opportunity expand industrial sector increase condition monitor asset management offer first quarter announce acquisition reliability asset reliability service software company strong presence across broad range industrial sector include metal mine power manufacture utility acquisition enable business expand asset performance management scale reliability technology utilize global footprint transaction reinforce commitment accelerate digital transformation industrial asset across ever increase range market third pillar position frontier take step build energy transition offer announce exclusive license international salt process carbon capture salt technology enable significant reduction energy efficient environmentally friendly carbon capture process provide total ownership save energy industrial operator decarbonize operation salt process portfolio capture technology development also include commercially available ammonia process base process compact carbon capture acquisition last year additionally recently announce intention invest hydrogen fund alongside cornerstone investor plug power chart industry fund target ultimate size approximately billion design accelerate infrastructure technology investment necessary develop hydrogen value chain also make progress commercially energy transition effort build diverse portfolio offer support scale technology development first quarter sign carbon storage project northern coast agreement explore development integration technology minimize carbon footprint delivery time project great example unique portfolio bring customer bring technology service drill complete injection supply subsea tree control system injection riser supply compression equipment injection phonetic provide monitor solution continue execute three strategic pillar evolution energy technology company maintain discipline prioritize free cash flow return capital give update segment oilfield service activity increase solidly select area year strong commodity price performance result positive sign improvement across multiple region course international market greater confidence outlook second half customer conversation project opportunity firm market middle east base discussion customer still expect recovery international activity second half weight provide strong momentum growth north stronger expect activity first quarter help mitigate impact winter storm also provide upside potential full year versus prior expectation although count move higher believe commitment toward capital discipline maintenance mode spend remain intact among public please outlook improve somewhat faster anticipate primary focus remain increase margin return profile business improve efficiency portfolio action continue execute plan reduce rooftop approximately facility size product line appropriately current environment overall believe remain track achieve double digit operate income margin give significant structural reduction make improve operate process increase remote operation move continue balance focus energy initiative current core operation like high technology compression application pump valve aftermarket service mention earlier long term outlook demand growth market improve resilience demand pandemic combine acceleration climate commitment result improve optimism demand outlook also reflect conversation customer nation make zero commitment become increasingly clear phase coal favor natural necessary reach goal broader global carbon target base outlook feel increasingly confident expectation three four project reach follow strong pipeline opportunity beyond segment portfolio order activity remain solid positive outlook first quarter book award power generation compression equipment multiple platform service optimistic outlook recovery customer resume spend maintain case upgrade equipment expect growth lead recovery transactional service upgrade area particularly impact contractual service business please receive year contract extension exist global service contract project largest facility world contract extension year partnership relationship include technology injection help customer increase production capacity reduce machine downtime save extend mean time maintenance longer term basis optimistic outlook upgrade opportunity customer seek reduce carbon emission improve efficiency equipment example first quarter announce cooperation agreement upgrade exist liquefaction train hydrogen blend support emission reduction effort together introduce first solution decarbonize core production area expect grow meaningfully future next oilfield equipment continue focus right size business optimize portfolio face challenge offshore market environment price move optimistic view demand next year continue outlook industry subsea tree award improve modestly though still level longer term believe deepwater activity increasingly dominate basin difficult sustain industry order level foreseeable future mention first quarter announce agreement create joint venture company deliver global offshore drill solution combination business business transaction result lead equipment service provider integrate delivery capability financial strength focus experience management flexibility address full range customer priority finally digital solution although operate result initial expectation experience strong recovery order first quarter primarily lead industrial market global economy begin recover first quarter award several project demonstrate capability emission reduction solution grow industrial presence product line secure several order flare advance flare monitor optimization system contract operator north sign agreement customer pilot flare technology mark first deployment flare region technology enable customer reduce methane emission flare operation reduce operational pilot site deliver high efficiency flare combustion also please secure important award major aircraft engine utilize technology improve fuel efficiency performance displace competitor dual channel pressure sensor technology enable customer deliver improve fuel efficiency reliability performance technology business award several order energy solution support electric vehicle battery cell inspection across facility overall execute first quarter deliver strong
