face supply chain delay impact product delivery look macro environment global economy continue recover however pace growth hamper linger effect delta variant global chip shortage supply chain issue energy supply constraint multiple part world despite headwind global growth appear relatively solid foot underpin favorable outlook market continue spend discipline world largest producer natural market fundamental remain strong combination solid demand growth extremely tight supply many part world fact believe positive case structural demand growth natural part broader energy transition become increasingly evident current environment illustrate need policy maker focus utilization natural baseload fuel combine renewable energy source provide cleaner safer affordable reliable source energy population around world number develop economy great success last year lower carbon emission switch coal natural however policy scenario rapid conversion straight renewables limit role natural transition fuel lead broader grid instability believe strong logical combination secure stable baseload natural need complement renewable energy source turn offset recent event move aggressively begin surface multiple part world experience energy shortage unprecedented increase energy price shutdown across multiple industry increase natural price acute number factor include investment reserve decline contribution hydroelectric renewable power continue increase energy demand ironically fallout higher price also lead increase coal consumption lead coal shortage spike coal price natural contributor lower emission unite state last year power generation consumption switch coal natural power consumption natural increase around total generation roughly past year coal consumption decline energy supply approximately period comparison today roughly pacific power generation come coal natural country step carbon reduction commitment believe natural play critical role displace higher emission source like coal support growth renewable energy technology relatively cheaper affordable baseload power natural core strategy continue play role provide natural safe reliable resource world
