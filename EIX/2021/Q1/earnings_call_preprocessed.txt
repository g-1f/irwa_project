activity first quarter largely base authorize base revenue requirement financial performance remark investor view risk profile give news report head another wildfire season average risk share also average risk year record acre burn however really important however state successfully avoid scale catastrophic damage would like highlight three factor significantly improve risk profile state investment improve firefighting progress implementation wildfire mitigation work first state increase investment firefighting capability last several year incorporate governor propose budget continue trend would represent increase fire budget since increase season since significant increase equipment model enhance state wildfire suppression capability example state expect seven large tanker operate fire season another five enhance suppression resource help state move quickly combat wildfire become catastrophic propose budget also focus wildfire prevention governor legislature already take early action earlier month approve million accelerate land forest management project wildfire forest resilience action plan additional million roughly fire fire season also significant staff resource addition local fire department response time firefighting capacity second risk improvement factor make steady timely progress past nearly year enact provision design instance shortly legislature pass open proceed emergency basis establish charge fund half wildfire insurance fund another indicator commission approve annual safety certification timely manner certification step implement prudency standard utility conduct deem reasonable valid safety certification unless serious doubt create importantly standard beyond life wildfire insurance fund commission establish wildfire safety division provide additional wildfire safety oversight direction lastly complete numerous wildfire relate decision timely pace despite pandemic commission also proactive engage public safety power execution time acknowledge within utility discretion crucial tool protect public safety take together sign intent implement steadily design third risk improvement factor work reduce wildfire risk fire mitigation integral part operational practice year utility several program place manage reduce wildfire risk climate change intensify wildfire risk utility step comprehensive wildfire mitigation strategy make substantial progress particularly continue invest infrastructure technology mitigate risk fire electric infrastructure increase accuracy fire weather forecast enhance operational practice improve program assemble dedicate readiness address feedback customer public safety partner elect official regulatory agency utility accelerate pace cover conductor deployment expect install least additional circuit mile year pace harden mile overhead distribution infrastructure high fire risk area substantially reduce risk wildfire associate utility equipment combination investment action state give increase confidence international improve risk profile respect wildfire slide deck provide additional information year date wildfire mitigation activity state action last year work also build block longer term reliability resiliency essential electrification increase dramatically across entire economy decarbonization speak decarbonization agree goal president trillion infrastructure proposal address climate change create improve quality particularly vulnerable community increase global competitiveness future require substantial deployment electrification build investment electric infrastructure ensure clean reliable resilient electric service greater demand look forward work administration leader congress develop implement complementary policy effectively meet nationally determine contribution target greenhouse reduction across economy relative close alignment outline pathway white paper already state support economywide target prior release highlight pathway least expensive achieve economywide decarbonization equitable clean energy future increase amount carbon free generation power electrification economy average customer also benefit decline total energy third thank greater efficiency electric technology slide earn deck provide additional information view area long track record maintain affordability near term customer increase bill invest grid harden make investment need support clean energy goal long term affordability yield decade proactively pursue reduction effort improvement area like reliability operational excellence effort expect embed digital tool deep operation area like inspection vegetation management enable efficiency work better harness data improve asset management performance reduce risk build robust capability lean process management help drive efficiency create stronger basis automation technology streamline operation fundamentally deliver value customer start excellent safe operator safe delivery reliable affordable electricity close comment acknowledge yesterday news colleague good friend strategy regulatory affair leave role executive corporate affair lose great really great year half together wish take important challenge task help leadership turn around operation relationship stakeholder community need utility healthy strong really glad state continue benefit talent provide financial report executive vice president chief financial officer thank good afternoon everyone comment today cover first quarter result capital expenditure rate base forecast regulatory file update financial topic international report core earn share first quarter increase share period last year note earlier year year comparison particularly meaningful receive decision general rate case page first quarter driver right hand side would like highlight handful item account much variance begin revenue higher share relate revenue contribute variance primarily higher rate base relate revenue contribute variance however offset balance account expense effect earn positive variance largely lower wildfire mitigation relate lower employee benefit expense wildfire mitigation expense lower first quarter primarily fewer remediation identify inspection process also negative variance increase depreciation higher asset base lower finance positive variance several item include lower interest rate balance account lower prefer dividend redemption prefer stock last year finally quarter lower dilution increase share outstanding primarily associate equity offer would like comment capital expenditure rate base growth forecast show page capital rate base forecast unchanged last quarter pending final decision track execute capital plan target program maintain flexibility later year adapt ultimately authorize decision rate base forecast include certain project program approve include customer service platform project operational earlier month expect file application recovery later year approve could approximately million rate base also reflect capital spend fire restoration relate wildfire affect facility equipment late evaluate determine much incremental current rate base forecast please turn page regulatory front remain hopeful receive propose decision track quarter reminder vote final decision sooner issue propose decision consistent prior practice issue earn guidance receive final decision additionally file testimony track first quarter track request recovery million revenue requirement find reasonable million incremental wildfire mitigation capital expenditure file another step towards recovery wildfire mitigation already incur page provide summary approve pending recovery application incremental wildfire relate include track mention page come month request finance order would allow securitize authorize track residential uncollectibles additional capital authorize track expect total request approximately billion compose million relate capital million wildfire mitigation relate million incremental residential uncollectible expense associate economic effect pandemic relate wildfire mudslide event continue make solid progress settle remain individual plaintiff claim show page first quarter resolve approximately million individual plaintiff claim total bring resolve claim approximately billion represent third best estimate total loss remain unchanged would like provide update finance plan issuance security billion equity content discuss last earn call reiterate previous statement equity content support maintain investment grade utility first quarter international issue billion prefer stock equity content approximately million continue monitor market condition consider additional prefer equity internal program need exist market program satisfy balance equity content need year beyond continue expect minimal equity need associate ongoing capital program quantify receive final decision conclude remark vice president investor relation please open call question operator instruction question answer operator thank operator instruction ahead analyst good afternoon executive vice president chief financial officer president chief executive officer analyst want start plan could grant kind early inning could still change form wonder right impact think plan would particularly relate transmission could share think president chief executive officer yeah give high level think early know administration provide last week start plan detail fill administration also ultimately congress right divide congress expect anything happen least congressional side bipartisan therefore something party work think highest level mention prepare remark absolutely support overall economywide direction reduction greenhouse emission initial element plan clean energy electrification transmission part plan line really nicely feasible cheapest pathway work really good alignment term strategy think provide long term support talk last several year perspective make investment need prepare grid able manage transition support customer electrify build space water heat electrify transportation think term core utility investment mean think importantly support core program outline know provide guidance beyond rate case cycle date expect robust spend need investment need next several year certainly past rate case really look wide basis estimate pathway investment need something like billion across need clean energy resource renewables storage transmission investment transmission part alone transmission distribution part around billion think chart deck provide little detail think page show billion breakout state long think supportive core investment opportunity upside opportunity extent utility meet play role core grade investment example storage program like charge ready charge ready transport right final thing press morning campaign trail president talk power sector stand alone basis zero discussion potentially target reduction level power sector yeah speak perspective broader industry perspective line much national level really stretch think feasibility nationwide transition give fact nine year still technology need help fill significant technology deployment would need particularly transmission side capital investment permit process take quite pathway analysis actually conclude would something like decrease greenhouse emission level national analysis others suggest national number aggressive pathway might still maybe think discussion among industry administration congress define much soon define make sure transition reliable affordable equitable customer across country analyst helpful thank president chief executive officer maybe want analyst great thank maybe kind pivot bite think kind higher level come inverse condemnation think legal challenge past wonder think front change outlook challenge forward think could share would helpful thank president chief executive officer yeah maybe brief near term please resolve inverse condemnation create fair framework think wrong view significantly reduce risk exposure utility across state term change state current approach inverse think unlikely legislative action anytime soon quite frankly work legislature wildfire issue already full agenda help economy recover pandemic expect whole bandwidth take near term always possibility could court case inverse could test challenge probably premature detail specific court case aware might case load utility also opportunity challenge inverse always possibility court system analyst helpful thank president chief executive officer thank operator thank next question come bank ahead president chief executive officer bank analyst good afternoon thank time perhaps year outset appreciate comment mitigation action take wildfire comment little bite wildfire probability weather event materialize thus risk profile fall especially relative versus mitigation effort already pursue would frame risk profile seem attention back president chief executive officer yeah thank dedicate first part comment frame guess would recap part maybe little bite recap part think external forecast call likely average fire risk period think term mitigation fair amount detail maybe would remind approach take last several year risk inform approach replace first mile bare wire cover conductor mile highest risk area possible right stack address highest risk area first mitigation would highest impact risk reduction every piece work reduce risk bite early think really helpful constructive term frame risk profile risk profile continue narrow stuff mention prepare remark also state dedicate outstanding effort improve firefighting model firefighting period capability fire suppression capability ability state frankly fight multiple large fire simultaneously might recall mention show really interest time article around challenge state fight camp fire fire hill fire simultaneously state qualify body plane truck equipment able deploy across multiple front simultaneously significant piece risk reduction sure give quality quantify answer therefore explain phonetic lower think significant percent difference term overall risk profile state face therefore face right bank analyst excellent thank know tough question clarify comment million individual claim look prospectively specific milestone could drive perhaps resolution remain claim third anything could front executive vice president chief financial officer yeah think continue disclose every quarter progress make mention individual plaintiff sort like homogeneous group several claim property damage claim continue move process make discussion individual plaintiff streamline efficient possible come back every quarter know progress bank analyst okay thank best luck president chief executive officer thank operator thank next question come vertical research partner ahead vertical research partner analyst good afternoon president chief executive officer executive vice president chief financial officer vertical research partner analyst wonder could talk little bite approach specifically avoid issue could come take past also obviously sort criterion front curious work anything similar update whole situation president chief executive officer start would separate space broad category actual physical execution plan engineer behind prosecution second would broad communication element think frankly pretty term core execution last several year right utility significant prior investment grid remember report earn call probably year year half back point something like look circuit high fire risk area average could four separate section right allow better target event continue segmentation device circuit high fire risk area continue hone scope event better plan significant improvement term number customer impact give event though much weather drive happen tough weather event necessitate tool last resort last resort right drive number even look various file utility make process take look number think actually percentage total customer basis lowest percent customer impact season importantly continue work believe allow significantly reduce impact customer impact last year weather last year course weather assumption basis would pretty significant reduction impact think number close reduction impact customer impact last year good thing term modern capability able triage strip impact event communication side think opportunity frankly pretty point feedback customer community local government look action plan file continue better thing okay also much better thing okay focus timely communication customer community local government emergency operation center improve quality communication vehicle area hope customer expect customer good improvement next season miss executive vice president chief financial officer yeah guess would thing still along line communicate customer really focus additional program could benefit energize think obviously component think clear tool necessary important help customer energize think aspect would file action plan opportunity communicate commission think cadence every week really provide opportunity ongoing dialog around think important aspect year president chief executive officer great glad example battery program deployment battery something really increase emphasis appropriately vertical research partner analyst sure often make people president chief executive officer absolutely right important protective tool protect health safety community vertical research partner analyst okay maybe sense sort seem extend time bite commission move pretty whole host thing maybe case statutory deadline think still wait executive vice president chief financial officer yeah would read anything complicate case request different component like think work different aspect paper propose decision vertical research partner analyst right thank president chief executive officer thank operator next question come ahead partner president chief executive officer hello partner analyst good afternoon actually fill couple quick follow question answer mention kind quiet part file call contra vertical proceed curious sense kind process cycle kind prospective improvement timeliness decision indicative staff close since everything else move forward president chief executive officer yeah hear question right broadly right partner analyst president chief executive officer right think mention prepare comment bite move expeditiously whole stuff throw pandemic frankly think perform pretty admirably give amount number ball juggle blue make tougher impact operation extra volume work create right think right complex case obviously would still hopeful quarter mention comment think anything systemic problem process break contrary provide number example prepare remark around thing like safety certification disposition number recovery account think difficult time obviously would like soon part sense something gear systemically anything differently executive vice president chief financial officer agree partner analyst thank color really helpful kind last follow mention kind driver kind lower expense relate fewer mitigation activity kind wildfire risk little bite broadly guess study kind extremely moisture content forest year fire season kind guess another kind high wildfire risk year kind qualify little bite enough recoverable capacity another year wildfire risk condition guess broadly kind think rate inflation even near term know kind mention longer term issue bounce near term kind mitigate factor understand rate inflation president chief executive officer yeah maybe take want executive vice president chief financial officer never hear president chief executive officer first part yeah first part certainly risk around moisture content basically sign point number average risk talk capacity think multiple first foremost focus fact believe thing need wildfire mitigation plan help mitigate side risk believe state thing need fire suppression resource ready help control fire think question also rate pressure side know comment already maybe follow executive vice president chief financial officer sure think mention lower expense relate wildfire mitigation inspection find fewer area remediate think broadly still associate mitigate risk talk fact commission convene bond long talk affordability continue focus people necessity wildfire mitigation expenditure squarely maintain safety community longer term look really mean electric rate electrify economy mean rate also mean energy bill think think affordability commission stakeholder look different perspective total share wallet energy represent electric bill affordability define different commission thing like many hour work minimum wage order electric bill think ongoing discussion know wildfire mitigation important safety community know broader electrification important greenhouse environmental objective state important think affordability also equitable community also participate improvement environment think ongoing discussion commission rightfully focus focus mention many year cycle manage electrify economy allow help increase affordability partner analyst thank helpful commentary thank take question president chief executive officer okay thank operator thank operator instruction next question come ahead analyst thank take question mine might question think take cash flow look slide slide slide even liability still mean think liability still need around billion base estimate want make sure double count think still good chunk cash come door outline item slide almost billion little billion securitization slide think source ample enough cash fund cash outflow acquire finalize settlement litigation finalize wildfire executive vice president chief financial officer couple thing think look page look page thing unique thing talk page securitized page probably easier kind maybe separately tick number general response question cash already spend wildfire mitigation securitizations recovery rate continue file application allow sort cash back door pressure often express issuance short term debt past fund short term debt past alleviate think claim perspective issue equity prefer equity past order sustain credit metric investment grade utility hold company equity issuance allow continue debt finance claim payment come shortly past insurance recovery able subject waiver keep debt outside capital structure cash fungible dollar impact exact time debt finance time fund business accordance authorize capital structure think general framework think number slide little bite overlap application translate securitizations page detail like later analyst great finally circle back highlight area could upside capex revisit little bite kind little bite quickly item impact kind beyond mean beyond president chief executive officer sure think probably term long term already last year thing near term materialize right charge ready program forecast quite approval application million program probably plus certainly billion worth capex come make ready program light duty heavy duty maybe duty vehicle example talk year process develop design program support think look near term term next decade half decade storage opportunity could present potential upside storage think third party whether large scale whether customer customer premise opportunity utility level grid side storage already rate case include assumption modest level particularly acceleration thing like vehicle electrification might lend place might make sense reinforce substation storage megawatt battery year kind near term call term think longer term upside transmission course quarter competition transmission want make sure utility able compete however remind project upgrade exist utility project utility right first refusal give scale value investment think need would handedly probably project upgrade exist line maybe consider really dependent independent system operator transmission plan process determine transmission need renewables later think transmission present another upside opportunity finally come back near term know mention remind customer service platform project could million rate base addition approve commission live early could also additional rate base addition wildfire restoration work fire quantify externally finalize analysis much kind block tackle near term opportunity analyst thank much appreciate president chief executive officer thank operator thank next question come ahead citigroup analyst good afternoon president chief executive officer citigroup analyst cadence settlement discussion continue recent week remain potential claim recognize smaller nature pace change president chief executive officer yeah probably able help much unfortunately confidential negotiation think share good news process mudslide plaintiff plaintiff individual plaintiff establish process approve court allow smoother approach work several thousand case remain would also mention smaller remain think smaller relative subrogation settlement earlier want make sure much look dollar amount settlement individual plaintiff relative number individual plaintiff case settle make assumption extrapolate remain case still case case really hard extrapolate dollar plaintiff ratio remain really case case think thing anchor review reserve best estimate every quarter make change estimate miss executive vice president chief financial officer think cover really anything term cadence pattern anything like think signpost look update every quarter amount settlement reach individual plaintiff really milestone citigroup analyst great could squeeze term follow around transmission growth opportunity outline pathway billion light presidential congressional bill congress permit underpin longer term growth outlook politics influx could accelerate light federal stakeholder president chief executive officer yeah maybe take probably honest answer give really early right significant discussion administration congress next week maybe even month think term frame time bite would expect administration want plan firmly place time conference party unite nation conference party hopefully sooner pace scale mean discussion right infrastructure package propose president hear billion plus number come proposal hear member talk package million mark influence relative degree emphasis different lever package case transmission think generally accept side transmission element equation translate federal incentive frankly perspective seem like would really like federal government money focus permit process help federal side streamline access federal land might need access right transmission line alone probably biggest lever accelerate piece permit process year year transmission project take decade build transmission project case back first point early game discussion ahead discussion guide level emphasis frankly transmission deep power sector timeframe compare deeper sector extent market mechanism versus sector sector allocation determine citigroup analyst appreciate thank president chief executive officer operator last question turn call back vice
