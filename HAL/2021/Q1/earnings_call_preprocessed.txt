strategic decision energy transition evolve take application next cohort participant continue bring early stage clean energy company enter optimistic focus innovation believe early positive momentum north continue international market recovery accelerate second half year continue execute strategic priority deliver industry lead return solid free cash flow anticipate multiyear recovery unfold turn call provide detail financial result chief financial officer thank begin morning overview first quarter result compare fourth quarter total company revenue quarter billion increase operate income million increase compare adjust operate income million fourth quarter take moment divisional result little bite detail completion production division revenue billion increase operate income million represent decrease increase revenue primarily drive higher stimulation artificial lift activity north higher cement activity north improve stimulation activity higher completion tool sale increase partially offset lower cement service lower pressure pump activity middle east reduce seasonal completion tool sale lower intervention service eastern hemisphere operate income negatively impact primarily decrease completion tool sale reduce pressure pump activity eastern hemisphere drill evaluation revenue billion increase operate income million increase increase primarily higher software sale globally improve drill relate service wireline activity western hemisphere increase project management activity internationally partially offset increase lower drill relate service across move geographical result north revenue billion represent increase result primarily drive higher drill relate service stimulation artificial lift activity north land higher wireline activity software sale north land partially offset increase reduce completion tool sale lower cement fluid activity move revenue million represent increase result primarily increase activity multiple product service line higher fluid service partially offset improvement reduce activity across multiple product service line turn revenue million decrease sequentially result mainly reduce completion tool sale intervention service across region couple lower activity lower fluid service decrease partially offset higher construction activity north increase software sale across region middle east revenue million decrease result primarily drive lower stimulation intervention service middle east reduce drill relate activity lower completion tool sale across region partially offset decline improve project management activity higher wireline activity across first quarter corporate expense total million look ahead second quarter anticipate corporate expense slightly higher interest expense quarter million expect level interest expense drift slightly lower second quarter result reduce debt balance effective rate first quarter approximately forward base anticipate market environment expect geographic earn expect full year effective rate approximately turn cash flow generate million cash operation first quarter million free cash flow also repay million mature debt cash hand first quarter continue prioritize reduce leverage near term capital expenditure quarter come million expect capital equipment delivery international project ramp second half year result full year capex guidance remain unchanged finally turn near term operational outlook provide comment second quarter unfold north expect completion drill activity momentum continue sequential activity growth moderate international market expect seasonal rebound broad base activity increase pace vary across different region result completion production division anticipate double digit revenue growth sequentially margin expect expand basis point result strong operate leverage across market drill evaluation division anticipate single digit revenue increase margin decline basis point sequentially moderate growth anticipate reduction margin primarily attribute seasonal decline software sale globally turn call back chairman president chief executive officer thank optimistic transition year shape demand outlook continue improve internationally domestically even region still experience lockdown year head right direction focus right thing deliver shareholder objective expect strong international business continue
