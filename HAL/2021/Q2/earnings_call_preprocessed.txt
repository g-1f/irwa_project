flow quarter bring year date free cash flow almost million please solid performance deliver first half transition year recent market volatility demonstrate fact remain transition year today want spend time discuss believe unfold next couple year first reaffirm outlook rest year second half expect activity momentum continue internationally still anticipate double digit increase activity compare second half even certain country continue face disruption commodity price remain supportive believe activity north inch higher drill outpace completion operator build inventory look beyond year describe longer term outlook believe early inning multiyear upcycle first time seven year anticipate simultaneous growth international north market view guide business objective expect outcome macro industry environment play next couple year first believe commodity price remain structurally supportive demand resurgence many economy increase vaccine availability anticipate global demand continue exceed supply particularly extent plus manage supply addition near term plus spare capacity return normalize level next year believe sufficient global demand support call international production second multiple year underinvestment international market couple anticipate demand growth give confidence healthy international recovery believe growth lead national company focus shorter cycle barrel activity come higher service intensity higher relative capital spend around wellbore oppose long cycle infrastructure investment expect mature field onshore offshore attract investment large scale greenfield exploration limit market result anticipate double digit annual international spend growth least next couple year third believe supportive commodity price environment normalize level spare plus capacity high decline rate shale constructive north spend expect drill completion spend north also grow double digit annually next year although activity return pandemic level expect private operator opportunistically lead activity come back public balance growth return fourth believe equipment availability tighten much faster people think multiple product line believe equipment supply fall behind anticipate demand today drill completion equipment near tightness north expect international market tighten next quarter give scarcity external capital source many north service company currently generate sufficient cash organically fund investment equipment innovation maintenance alone generate sufficient return internationally multiple year service company capex reduction limit equipment availability expect increase demand tighten equipment capacity lead higher price price begin return north expect internationally contract duration longer know positive macro outlook describe

thank good morning begin summary second quarter result compare first quarter total company revenue quarter billion operate income million increase respectively higher equipment utilization significant operate leverage support strong result count move globally second quarter take moment division result little detail start completion production division revenue billion increase operate income million increase improvement drive higher activity across multiple product service line north land improve cement activity eastern hemisphere increase completion tool sale middle east north higher intervention service improvement partially offset lower stimulation activity drill evaluation division revenue billion increase operate income million increase result drive improve drill relate service wireline activity across region along increase test service eastern hemisphere partially offset improvement reduce software sale globally move geographic result north revenue increase primarily drive higher pressure pump service drill relate service wireline activity north land higher construction activity partially offset increase reduce software sale across region turn revenue flat sequentially primarily drive increase activity multiple product service line higher fluid service additional completion tool sale result offset lower stimulation activity decrease software sale across region lower project management activity revenue increase result increase activity across multiple product service line increase partially offset lower software sale across region lower activity middle east region revenue increase result improve activity multiple product service line improve intervention service across region increase drill relate service higher completion tool sale improve construction activity increase pipeline service improvement offset lower software sale across region reduce project management activity lower overall activity second quarter corporate expense
