population growth time supply remain structural threat scarcity create short term dislocation commodity market fundamental supply tightness exist geopolitical conflict current supply tightness commodity price level strengthen confidence accelerate multi year upcycle busy year ahead addition expect important change customer behavior priority provide structural support price throughout upcycle believe supply dynamic fundamentally change investor return requirement public commitment regulatory pressure make difficult operator commit long cycle hydrocarbon investment instead drive investment flexibility short cycle barrel pursuit increase investment flexibility lead operator prioritize short cycle project development exploration tieback versus infrastructure shale rather deepwater clearly important exception successful long term project develop paint broad brush believe investment direct primarily toward short cycle activity near medium term result focus industrywide increase level investment flexibility operator subsequent support commodity price short cycle barrel company make investment decision annually respond quickly commodity price signal result investment stop production minimum grow case quickly decline example pandemic drive collapse demand year shale company swiftly reduce activity production decline million barrel nine month contrast long cycle project element long time horizon large upfront capital investment project begin investment continue production quickly respond price signal tend result market oversupply pivot short cycle barrel create opposite effect perpetual threat undersupply supportive commodity price believe pivot short cycle barrel great fantastic condition outperform short cycle activity result higher relative capital spend operator directly wellbore service provide oppose infrastructure investment require long cycle project strong technology portfolio market footprint match activity globally work innovate invest matter customer finally value proposition collaborate engineer solution maximize asset value customer explicitly focus help operator maximize return cash flow make uniquely relevant environment five strategic priority clear effective drive behavior upcycle first focus profitable growth strong international franchise second maximize value cash flow north third accelerate deployment integration

five strategic priority deliver industry lead return strong free cash flow shareholder look across international market continue believe customer international spend increase teen year lead indicator first start revenue first quarter much higher compare period last year second completion order book increase year year first quarter represent work generally deliver within current year third strong pipeline project schedule start second half year particularly middle east expect international activity gain momentum second quarter lead middle east accelerate second half year importantly strong first quarter drill evaluation division margin demonstrate focus profitable international growth beyond shift short cycle barrel already discuss expect international upcycle structurally different prior cycle international business benefit national company independent comprise larger portion international customer result divestiture last year many international asset owner require collaborative service provider help unlock remain reserve maximize value collaborative approach broad technology portfolio local expertise reliable execution help customer achieve efficiency production objective execution technology roadmap completely transform competitiveness drill evaluation enter upcycle best product portfolio history increase customer demand high technology recognition value example recently deploy wireline image service multiple customer help operator acquire accurate data synthetic base better evaluate production potential save time capability increase speed another example latest addition drill suite service thin enter formation similar premium service combine high fidelity downhole sensor powerful digital capability multiple customer middle east faster accurate reservoir characterization precisely place productive zone maximize asset value also slight uptick offshore exploration activity albeit historically base increase competitiveness drill evaluation result double contract rate global exploration work last year expect benefit additional growth higher margin market different prior cycle investment specialty chemical artificial lift create unique growth opportunity expand international footprint business last month attend open chemical reaction plant multiple year make world class facility establish chemical manufacture footprint eastern hemisphere profitable growth specialty chemical industry middle east beyond quarter start manufacture product production chemical contract large chemical product service line several year describe digitalization define trend industry decade today digital innovation permeate segment oilfield service market strategy drive digital automation create technological differentiation contribute higher international margin drive internal efficiency save example integrate drill project southeast deploy construction approach digital transformation construction improve rate penetration initial reduce site personnel integrate project middle east combine data science smart bite drill automation project management service reduction average delivery time also deploy digital solution advance sustainable energy future first quarter energy enter carbon storage potential basin decision space cloud application perform long term model characterize storage complex create conceptual development plan performance model expect deliver steady profitable growth international market rest year increase activity equipment tightness continue sharpen price discussion customer price increase current contract extension first quarter percentage contract extension exercise almost double compare period last year operator generally prefer extend exist contract rather work inflationary market price also increase newer turn north market tightness across service segment first quarter average count increase sequentially year year additionally frac activity surge march winter weather supply chain disruption occur earlier quarter hydraulic fracture fleet remain sell overall market appear sell second half year market today present several positive element previously absent north give confidence continue strength market come year first largest service segment north hydraulic fracture market structure improve today largest four pressure pump company account third market second believe poor service industry return many year north ultimately result close loop capital system access meaningful outside capital exist today market participant must generate cash order reinvest grow business broad base profitability improvement require fund growth appear good economics single incremental fleet finally greater differentiation hydraulic fracture equipment type prior cycle fleet relatively today equipment create equal significant operational environmental price difference exist range electric fleet dual fuel tier diesel middle finally tier diesel equipment bottom terrific fleet composition leader emission frac equipment commit contract earn attractive return deliver improve performance another technology apart rest hydraulic fracture market intelligent fracture system customer adopt groundbreaking technology move pilot campaign mode deploy multiple operator across different basin expect fold increase number stage complete year tightness north hydraulic fracture equipment exist across whole value chain spare part engine electronics many input sometimes immediately available generally increase operator also effective solution minimize operational impact provide reliable execution customer example supply chain organization respond source sand local mine truck collaboration provide real time information market clear price driver allow manage inflation significantly reduce logistics relate nonproductive time year price return impact north oilfield service sector larger supply chain support industry sustainably improve price require avoid future supply chain disruption invest equipment people technology necessary deliver production growth believe customer understand backdrop long runway ongoing price improvement across product service line recovery focus maximize value north margin cycle build cycle last quarter share view north customer spend would grow year year today look combination customer activity inflation outlook improve expect north spend increase year respect activity land count private company keep grow public remain commit activity plan activity demand service increase internationally north unique value proposition
