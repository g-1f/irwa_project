project schedule satisfy milestone long term customer project believe important metric regulate project nature megawatt hour remain within previously guide levelized energy range megawatt hour potential save realize future legislation could also pass customer example still early estimate expansion credit benefit offshore wind would reduce customer megawatt hour develop project current stage gain critical insight primary source first megawatt pilot project consist operate turbine federal water provide considerable benefit development plan full scale development example pilot project provide better information wind resource coast initially assume lifetime capacity factor full scale deployment evaluation turbine design wind resource addition realtime data gather test turbine
