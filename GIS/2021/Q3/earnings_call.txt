OperatorGreetings and welcome to the fiscal 2021 Q3 earnings call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Siemon, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Jeff Siemon -- Vice President, Investor RelationsThanks Jennifer, and good morning to everyone. On behalf of my colleagues at General Mills, thanks for joining us. We are looking forward to have our live Q&A session on our third quarter results. Hope everyone had a chance to review our press release, listen to our prepared remarks and view our presentation materials, which were made available this morning on our Investor Relations site.Also refer to the press release we issued yesterday, announcing our proposed sale of our European Yoplait operations to Sodiaal. I'll just note that in regard to that transaction, we have a memorandum of understanding and that is still subject to appropriate labor consultations, regulatory filings and other customary closing conditions. And we expect to close the proposed transaction by the end of the calendar year.Further more, it's important to note that in our Q&A session today, we may make forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions, including facts and assumptions related to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results in fiscal '21. Please refer to this morning's press release for factors that could impact our forward-looking statements and for reconciliations of non-GAAP information which may be discussed on today's call.I'm here virtually with Jeff Harmening, our Chairman and CEO; Kofi Bruce, our CFO; Bethany Quam, Group President for our Pet segment; and Jon Nudi, Group President for North America Retail. We're holding this call from different locations, so hopefully technology cooperates and everything goes smoothly.And with that, we can get into the first question. Jennifer, you can get us started.
