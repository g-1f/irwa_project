question call schedule hour mark mark president chief executive officer good morning everyone thank join today cover four topic highlight third quarter first nine month year change observe test market outlook industrial automation market think test automation market close year look beyond result demonstrate demand remain strong across business company level sale grow last year record grow experience increase supply chain bottleneck industrial automation business quarter ship demand describe detail expect constraint persist despite first nine month company wide sale grow grow year level business write long term secular trend expect drive revenue earn growth year come test business unit growth complexity driver power market continue unabated example semiconductor test business grow lead charge grow sale continue dominate product line align performance requirement grow compute mobility market additionally sale test system double nine month period automotive industrial test market also rapidly expand unique architecture sweet spot market balance high precision stress test need demand application within clear shift year higher demand compute automotive industrial market mobility still largest segment grow drop high range test market recent year high range year midterm expect mobility remain largest submarket continue grow also expect compute grow faster rate automotive remain current elevate level last decade mobility make rapid annual advance semiconductor complexity enable advancement smartphone sophistication refresh pace much faster traditional graphic automotive industrial market lead smartphone rapidly progress along complexity scale true many area smartphone silicon apps processor compute engine graphic engine engine image sensor power management lead position test technology drive growth time recently traditional compute test market relatively flat slower refresh rate slower complexity growth however groundwork mobility design combine advance lithography node design tool enable entrant chip design space compute engine complexity chip whether laptop server autonomous drive graphic incredible advance accelerate rate example laptop cross
