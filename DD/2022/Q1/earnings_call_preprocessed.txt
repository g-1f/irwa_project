semiconductor healthcare display market cyclical recovery aerospace market share gain innovation mute somewhat auto supply chain constraint example recent product success drive growth strong margin performance include newly launch mechanical semiconductor manufacture photoresist high performance compute market expect growth come line business safety market growth across major segment include aerospace electrical infrastructure healthcare mute lower demand protective shelter continue experience growth opportunity strong construction remodel trend water experience strong high single digit growth globally across technology example innovation driver segment include several membrane product family within water drive growth desalination wastewater market launch build insulation product offer increase sustainability solution customer also strong adhesive business position capture growth product offer next generation auto electric vehicle especially commercial synergy opportunity
